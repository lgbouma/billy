Applying Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI) to our observations, concentrating in 2015 November and 2016 January and spanning 72 d in total, 16 d in 2015 November and 13 d in 2016 January, we reconstruct surface brightness and magnetic field maps for both epochs and demonstrate that both distributions exhibit temporal evolution not explained by differential rotation alone. We report the detection of a hot Jupiter (hJ) around TAP 26 using three different methods, two using ZDI and one Gaussian-process regression (GPR), with a false-alarm probability smaller than 6 × 10-4. However, as a result of the aliasing related to the observing window, the orbital period cannot be uniquely determined; the orbital period with highest likelihood is 10.79 ± 0.14 d followed by 8.99 ± 0.09 d.
Assuming the most likely period, and that the planet orbits in the stellar equatorial plane, we obtain that the planet has a minimum mass Msin I of 1.66 ± 0.31 MJup and orbits at 0.0968
± 0.0032 au from its host star. This new detection suggests that disc type II migration is efficient at generating newborn hJs, and that hJs may be more frequent around young T Tauri stars than around mature stars (or that the MaTYSSE sample is biased towards hJ-hosting stars).},

Our observations, carried out within the MaTYSSE (Magnetic Topologies of Young Stars and the Survival of close-in giant Exoplanets) programme, were spread over 91 d, and involved the ESPaDOnS and Narval spectropolarimeters linked to the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii, the 2-m Bernard Lyot, and the 8-m Gemini-North Telescopes. Using Zeeman-Doppler Imaging, we characterize the surface brightness distributions, magnetic topologies, and surface differential rotation of V830 Tau at the time of our observations, and demonstrate that both distributions evolve with time beyond what is expected from differential rotation. We also report that near the end of our
observations, V830 Tau triggered one major flare and two weaker
precursors, showing up as enhanced redshifted emission in multiple spectral activity proxies. With three different filtering techniques, we model the radial velocity (RV) activity jitter (of semi-amplitude 1.2 km s-1) that V830 Tau generates, successfully retrieve the 68 ± 11 m s-1 RV planet signal hiding behind the jitter, further confirm the existence of V830 Tau b, and better characterize its orbital parameters. We find that the method based on Gaussian-process regression performs best thanks to its higher ability at modelling not only the activity jitter, but also its temporal evolution over the course of our observations, and succeeds at reproducing our RV data down to an rms precision of 35 m s-1. Our result provides new observational constraints on scenarios of star/planet formation and demonstrates the scientific potential of large-scale searches for close-in giant planets around T Tauri stars.},

Near-infrared observations directly probe the location of the hottest dust. The characteristic sizes found are much larger than previously thought, and strongly correlate with the luminosity of the central young stars. This relation has motivated in part a new class of models of the inner disk structure. The first mid-infrared observations have probed disk emission over a larger range of scales, and spectrally resolved interferometry has for the first time revealed mineralogy gradients in the disk. These new measurements provide crucial information on the structure and physical properties of young circumstellar disks, as initial conditions for planet formation.},

Although this is reasonably well understood for the regions of the disk beyond about 1 AU, the structure of these disks inward of 1 AU remains a puzzle. This is partly because it is very difficult to spatially resolve these regions with current telescopes. But it is also because the physics of this region, where the disk becomes so hot that the dust starts to evaporate, is poorly understood. With infrared interferometry it has become possible in recent years to directly spatially resolve the inner 1 AU of
	protoplanetary disks, albeit in a somewhat limited way. These
	observations have partly confirmed current models of these regions, but also posed new questions and puzzles. Moreover, it has turned out that the numerical modeling of these regions is extremely challenging. In this review, we give a rough overview of the history and recent

The accretion in these trapped states can be steady or cyclic; we explore these states over a wide range of parameter space. We find two distinct regions of instability: one related to the buildup and release of mass in the disc outside corotation, and the other to mass storage within the transition region near corotation. With a set of calculations over long time-scales, we show how trapped states evolve from both non-accreting and fully accreting initial conditions, and also calculate the effects of cyclic accretion on the spin evolution of the star. Observations of cycles such as found here would provide important clues on the physics of magnetospheric accretion. Recent observations of cyclic and other unusual variability in T Tauri stars (EXors) and X-ray binaries are discussed in this context.},

	low-mass 'dipper' stars are known to have low accretion rates and
	primarily host moderately evolved dusty circumstellar discs. Young
	low-mass stars often exhibit rotating starspots that cause
	quasi-periodic photometric variations. We found no evidence for periods

	period in spectrograms constructed from the light curves. The material
	causing the dips in most of these light curves must be approximately
	corotating with the star. We find that disc temperatures computed at the
	disc corotation radius are cool enough that dust should not sublime.
	Crude estimates for stellar magnetic field strengths and accretion rates
	are consistent with magnetospheric truncation near the corotation
	radius. Magnetospheric truncation models can explain why the dips are
	associated with material near corotation and how dusty material is
	lifted out of the mid-plane to obscure the star that would account for
	the large fraction of young low-mass stars that are dippers. We propose
	that variations in disc orientation angle, stellar magnetic field dipole
	tilt axis and disc accretion rate are underlying parameters accounting

using data from the 2MASS Calibration Database. For each target in this sample, up to 1584 individual J-, H-, and Ks -band
photometric measurements with a cadence of {\textasciitilde}1 day are obtained over three observing seasons spanning {\textasciitilde}2.5 yr it is the most intensive survey of stars in this region to date. This survey identifies 101 variable stars with ΔKs -band amplitudes from 0.044 to 2.31 mag and Δ(J - Ks ) color amplitudes ranging from 0.053 to 1.47 mag. Of the 72 young ρ Oph star cluster members included in this survey, 79\% are variable; in addition, 22 variable stars are identified as candidate members. Based on the temporal behavior of the Ks time-series, the variability is distinguished as either periodic, long time-scale or irregular. This temporal behavior coupled with the behavior of stellar colors is used to assign a dominant variability mechanism. A new period-searching algorithm finds periodic signals in 32 variable stars with periods between 0.49 to 92 days. The chief mechanism driving the periodic variability for 18 stars is rotational modulation of cool starspots while 3 periodically vary due to accretion-induced hot spots. The time-series for six variable stars contains discrete periodic "eclipse-like" features with periods ranging from 3 to 8 days. These features may be asymmetries in the circumstellar disk, potentially sustained or driven by a proto-planet at or near the co-rotation radius. Aperiodic, long time-scale variations in stellar flux are identified in the time-series for 31 variable stars with time-scales ranging from 64 to 790 days. The chief mechanism driving long time-scale variability is variable extinction or mass accretion rates. The majority of the variable stars (40) exhibit sporadic, aperiodic variability over no discernable time-scale. No chief
variability mechanism could be identified for these variable stars.},

companions to 1120 M dwarf primaries known to lie within 25 pc of the
Sun via trigonometric parallaxes. In addition to a comprehensive
literature search, stars were explored in new surveys for companions at
separations of 2″-300″. A reconnaissance of wide
companions to separations of 300″ was done via blinking archival
images. I-band images were used to search our sample for companions at
separations of 2″-180″. Various astrometric and
photometric methods were used to probe the inner 2″ to reveal
close companions. We report the discovery of 20 new companions and
identify 56 candidate multiple systems. We find a stellar multiplicity
rate of 26.8 ± 1.4\% and a stellar companion rate of 32.4 ±
1.4\% for M dwarfs. There is a broad peak in the separation distribution
of the companions at 4-20 au, with a weak trend of smaller
projected linear separations for lower mass primaries. A hint that
M-dwarf multiplicity may be a function of tangential velocity is found,
with faster moving, presumably older, stars found to be multiple
somewhat less often. We calculate that stellar companions make up at
least 17\% of mass attributed to M dwarfs in the solar neighborhood, with
roughly 11\% of M-dwarf mass hidden as unresolved companions. Finally,
when considering all M-dwarf primaries and companions, we find that the
mass distribution for M dwarfs increases to the end of the stellar main
sequence.},

	abstract = {With the loss of two spacecraft reaction wheels precluding further data collection for the Kepler primary mission, even greater pressure is placed on the processing pipeline to eke out every last transit signal in the data. To that end, we have developed a new method to optimize the Kepler Simple Aperture Photometry (SAP) photometric apertures for both planet detection and minimization of systematic effects. The approach uses a per cadence modeling of the raw pixel data and then performs an aperture optimization based on signal-to-noise ratio and the Kepler Combined Differential Photometric Precision (CDPP), which is a measure of the noise over the duration of a reference transit signal. We have found the new apertures to be superior to the previous Kepler apertures. We can now also find a per cadence flux fraction in aperture and crowding metric. The new approach has also been proven to be robust at finding apertures in K2 data that help mitigate the larger motion-induced systematics in the photometry. The method further allows us to identify errors in the Kepler and K2 input catalogs.},

Detailed modeling of the broadband spectral energy distributions, particularly the strong silicate emission at 10 μm, shows that these objects are (pre-)transitional disks with some amount of small optically thin dust inside their cavities, ranging from ∼4 to ∼90 au in size. We analyzed Spitzer IRS spectra for two objects in the sample: CVSO-107 and CVSO-109. The IRS spectrum of CVSO-107 indicates the presence of crystalline material inside its gap, while the silicate feature of CVSO-109 is characterized by a pristine profile produced by amorphous silicates; the mechanisms creating the optically thin dust seem to depend on disk local conditions. Using millimeter photometry, we estimated dust disk masses for CVSO-107 and CVSO-109 lower than the minimum mass of solids needed to form the planets in our solar system, which suggests that giant planet formation should be over in these disks. We speculate that the presence and maintenance of optically thick material in the inner regions of these pre-transitional disks might point to low-mass planet formation.},

    photometry requires the removal or modeling of instrumental and stellar 
    noise. While instrumental systematics can be reduced using methods such as 
    pixel level decorrelation, removing stellar trends while preserving 
    transit signals proves challenging. Due to vast archives of light curves 
    from recent transit surveys, there is a strong need for accurate automatic 
    detrending, without human intervention. A large variety of detrending 
    algorithms are in active use, but their comparative performance for 
    transit discovery is unexplored. We benchmark all commonly used detrending 
    methods against hundreds of Kepler, K2, and TESS planets, selected to 
    represent the most difficult cases for systems with small planet-to-star 
    radius ratios. The full parameter range is explored for each method to 
    determine the best choices for planet discovery. We conclude that the 
    ideal method is a time-windowed slider with an iterative robust location 
    estimator based on Tukey's biweight. This method recovers 99\% and 94\% of 
    the shallowest Kepler and K2 planets, respectively. We include an 
    additional analysis for young stars with extreme variability and conclude

The Astrocut package has two parts: the CubeFactory and the CutoutFactory. The CubeFactory class creates a large image cube from a list of FFI files, which allows the cutout operation to be performed efficiently. The CutoutFactory class performs the actual cutout and builds a target pixel file (TPF) that is compatible with TESS pipeline TPFs. Because this software operates on TESS mission-produced FFIs, the resulting TPFs are not background-subtracted. In addition to the Astrocut software itself, the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) provides a cutout service, TESScut, which runs Astrocut on MAST servers, and allows users to simply request cutouts through a web form or direct HTTP API query.},

We refit the transit events in the Kepler light curves for these planet candidates and combine the revised planet/star radius ratios with our improved stellar radii to revise the radii of the planet candidates orbiting the cool target stars. We then compare the number of observed planet candidates to the number of stars around which such planets could have been detected in order to estimate the planet occurrence rate around cool stars. We find that the occurrence rate of 0.5-4 R ⊕ planets with

The occurrence rate of Earth-size (0.5-1.4 R ⊕) planets is constant across the temperature range of our sample at 0.51\_\{-0.05\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.06\} Earth-size planets per star, but the occurrence of 1.4-4 R ⊕ planets decreases significantly at cooler

Our 95\% confidence lower limit on the occurrence rate of Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of cool stars is 0.04 planets per star.

star-forming region in order to characterize the primordial outcome of
multiple star formation and the extent of the brown dwarf desert. Our
survey identified 16 new binary companions to primary stars with masses
of 0.25-2.5 M sun, raising the total number of binary pairs
(including components of high-order multiples) with separations of
3-5000 AU to 90. We find that {\textasciitilde}2/3-3/4 of all Taurus members are
multiple systems of two or more stars, while the other {\textasciitilde}1/4-1/3 appear
to have formed as single stars; the distribution of high-order
multiplicity suggests that fragmentation into a wide binary has no
impact on the subsequent probability that either component will fragment
again. The separation distribution for solar-type stars (0.7-2.5 M
sun) is nearly log-flat over separations of 3-5000 AU, but
lower-mass stars (0.25-0.7 M sun) show a paucity of binary
companions with separations of gsim200 AU. Across this full mass range,
companion masses are well described with a linear-flat function; all
system mass ratios (q = MB /MA ) are equally
probable, apparently including substellar companions. Our results are
broadly consistent with the two expected modes of binary formation
(free-fall fragmentation on large scales and disk fragmentation on small
scales), but the distributions provide some clues as to the epochs at
which the companions are likely to form.},

traditional high-resolution imaging; we also summarize a complementary snapshot imaging survey that discovered seven directly resolved
companions. The overall frequency of binary companions
({\textasciitilde}35-4+5\% at separations of 6-435 AU) appears to be equivalent to field stars of similar mass, but companions could be more common among lower mass stars than for the field. The companion mass function has statistically significant differences compared to several suggested mass functions for the field, and we suggest an alternate lognormal parameterization of the mass function. Our survey limits encompass the entire brown dwarf mass range, but we only detected a single companion that might be a brown dwarf; this deficit resembles the so-called brown dwarf desert that has been observed by radial velocity planet searches. Finally, our survey's deep detection limits extend into the top of the planetary mass function, reaching 8-12 MJup for half of our sample. We have not identified any planetary companions at high confidence (gtrsim99.5\%), but we have identified four candidate companions at lower confidence (gtrsim97.5\%) that merit additional follow-up to confirm or disprove their existence.},

The frequency and main characteristics of multiple systems, and their dependence on primary mass and environment, are powerful tools to probe this process. Although early attempts were fraught with selection biases and limited completeness, instrumentation breakthroughs in the past two decades now enable robust statistical analyses. In this review, we summarize current empirical knowledge of stellar multiplicity for main sequence stars and brown dwarfs, as well as among populations of pre-main-sequence stars and embedded protostars. Among field objects, the multiplicity rate and breadth of the orbital period distribution are steep functions of the primary mass, whereas the mass ratio distribution is essentially flat for most populations other than the lowest mass objects. The time-variation of the frequency of visual companions follows two parallel, constant tracks corresponding to loose and dense stellar populations, although current observations do not yet distinguish whether initial multiplicity properties are universal or dependent on the physical conditions of the parent cloud. Nonetheless, these quantitative trends provide a rich comparison basis for numerical and analytical models of star formation.},

identify 336 stars as members of the cluster, using optical and
near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams. Using the spectral energy distribution slopes in the IRAC spectral range, we place objects into several classes: non-excess stars, stars with optically thick disks (such as classical T Tauri stars), class I (protostellar) candidates, and stars with ``evolved disks'' the last exhibit smaller IRAC excesses than optically thick disk systems. In general, this classification agrees with the location expected in IRAC-MIPS color-color diagrams for these objects. We find that the evolved disk systems are mostly a combination of objects with optically thick but nonflared disks, suggesting grain growth and/or settling, and transition disks, systems in which the inner disk is partially or fully cleared of small dust. In all, we identify seven transition disk candidates and three possible debris disk systems. As in other young stellar populations, the fraction of disks depends on the stellar mass, ranging from {\textasciitilde}10\% for stars in the Herbig Ae/Be mass range ({\textgreater}2 Msolar) to {\textasciitilde}35\% for those in the T Tauri mass range (1-0.1 Msolar). The IRAC infrared excesses found in stellar clusters and associations with and without central high-mass stars are similar, suggesting that external
photoevaporation is not very important in many clusters. Finally, we find no correlation between the X-ray luminosity and the disk infrared excess, suggesting that the X-rays are not strongly affected by disk accretion.},

candidates of the 5 Myr region located in the OB1b subassociation. The
25 Orionis aggregate shows a disk frequency of 6\%, while the field in
the OB1b subassociation shows a disk frequency of 13\%. Combining IRAC,
MIPS, and 2MASS photometry, we place stars bearing disks in several
classes: those with optically thick disks (class II systems), with an
inner transitional disks (transitional disk candidates), and with
``evolved disks'' the last exhibit smaller IRAC/MIPS excesses than class
II systems. In all, we identify one transitional disk candidate in the
25 Orionis aggregate and three in the OB1b field; this represents {\textasciitilde}10\%
of the disk-bearing stars, indicating that the transitional disk phase
can be relatively fast. We find that the frequency of disks is a
function of the stellar mass, suggesting a maximum around stars with
spectral type M0. Comparing the infrared excess in the IRAC bands among
several stellar groups, we find that inner disk emission decays with
stellar age, showing a correlation with the respective disk frequencies.
The disk emission at the IRAC and MIPS bands in several stellar groups
indicates that disk dissipation takes place faster in the inner region
of the disks. Comparison with models of irradiated accretion disks,
computed with several degrees of settling, suggests that the decrease in
the overall accretion rate observed in young stellar groups is not
sufficient to explain the weak disk emission observed in the IRAC bands
for disk-bearing stars with ages 5 Myr or older; larger degrees of dust
settling are necessary to explain these objects.},

regions of the Orion OB1 association located in the subassociations OB1a
({\textasciitilde}10 Myr) and OB1b ({\textasciitilde}5 Myr). In a representative sample of stars earlier
than F5 of both stellar groups, we find a population of stars surrounded
of debris disks, without excess in the IRAC bands and without emission
lines in their optical spectra, but with a varying degree of 24 μm
excess. Comparing our samples with 24 μm observations of
intermediate-mass stars in other stellar groups, spanning a range of
ages from 2.5 to 150 Myr, we find that debris disks are more frequent
and have larger 24 μm excess at 10 Myr (OB1a). This trend agrees with
predictions of models of evolution of solids in the outer regions of
disks ({\textgreater}30 AU), where large icy objects ({\textasciitilde}1000 km) begin to form at
{\textasciitilde}10 Myr; the presence of these objects in the disk initiates a
collisional cascade, producing enough dust particles to explain the
relatively large 24 μm excess observed in OB1a. The dust luminosity
observed in the stellar groups older than 10 Myr declines roughly as
predicted by collisional cascade models. Combining Spitzer observations,
optical spectra, and 2MASS data, we found a new Herbig Ae/Be star (HD
290543) and a star (HD 36444) with a large 24 μm excess, both in
OB1b. This last object could be explained as a intermediate stage
between HAeBe and true debris systems or as a massive debris disk
produced by a collision between two large objects ({\textgreater}1000 km).},

with varying degree of moderate 24 μm excess comparable to those
produced by debris disks in older stellar groups. As expected in debris
disks systems, those stars do not exhibit emission lines in their
optical spectra. We also include in our study the star HD 245185, a
known Herbig Ae object which displays excesses in all Spitzer bands and
shows emission lines in its spectrum. We compare the disk population in
the λ Orionis cluster with the disk census in other stellar
groups studied using similar methods to detect and characterize their
disks and spanning a range of ages from 3 Myr to 10 Myr. We find that
for stellar groups of 5 Myr or older the observed disk frequency in
intermediate-mass stars (with spectral types from late B to early F) is
higher than in low-mass stars (with spectral types K and M). This is in
contradiction with the observed trend for primordial disk evolution, in
which stars with higher stellar masses dissipate their primordial disks
faster. At 3 Myr, the observed disk frequency in intermediate-mass stars
is still lower than for low-mass stars indicating that second generation
dusty disks start to dominate the disk population at 5 Myr for
intermediate-mass stars. This result agrees with recent models of
evolution of solids in the region of the disk where icy objects form
({\textgreater}30 AU), which suggest that at 5-10 Myr collisions start to produce
large amount of dust during the transition from runaway to oligarchic
growth (reaching sizes of {\textasciitilde}500 km) and then dust production peaks at
10-30 Myr, when objects reach their maximum size ({\textgreater}=1000 km).},

sections of the ecliptic plane. During its second campaign, K2 targeted
over 1000 young stellar objects (YSOs) in the ∼1-3 Myr ρ
Ophiuchus and 5-10 Myr Upper Scorpius regions. From this set, we have
carefully vetted photometry from WISE and Spitzer to identify those YSOs
with infrared excess indicative of primordial circumstellar disks. We
present here the resulting comprehensive sample of 288 young
disk-bearing stars from B through M spectral types and analysis of their
associated K2 light curves. Using statistics of periodicity and
symmetry, we categorize each light curve into eight different
variability classes, notably including “dippers” (fading
events), “bursters” (brightening events), stochastic, and
quasi-periodic types. Nearly all (96\%) of disk-bearing YSOs are
identified as variable at 30-minute cadence with the sub-1\% precision of
K2. Combining our variability classifications with (circum)stellar
properties, we find that the bursters, stochastic sources, and the
largest amplitude quasi-periodic stars have larger infrared colors, and
hence stronger circumstellar disks. They also tend to have larger
Hα equivalent widths, indicative of higher accretion rates. The
dippers, on the other hand, cluster toward moderate infrared colors and
low Hα. Using resolved disk observations, we further find that the
latter favor high inclinations, except for a few notable exceptions with
close to face-on disks. These observations support the idea that YSO
time-domain properties are dependent on several factors, including
accretion rate and view angle.},

Their optical light curves show ∼10-20 dips in flux over the 80-day observing campaign with durations of ∼0.5-2 days and depths of up to ∼40\%. These stars are all
members of the ρ Ophiuchus (∼1 Myr) or Upper Scorpius (∼10
Myr) star-forming regions. To investigate the nature of these
“dippers” we obtained: optical and near-infrared spectra to
determine stellar properties and identify accretion signatures; adaptive optics imaging to search for close companions that could cause optical variations and/or influence disk evolution; and millimeter-wavelength observations to constrain disk dust and gas masses. The spectra reveal Li I absorption and Hα emission consistent with stellar youth
({\textless}50 Myr), but also accretion rates spanning those of classical and weak-line T Tauri stars. Infrared excesses are consistent with
protoplanetary disks extending to within ∼10 stellar radii in most cases; however, the sub-millimeter observations imply disk masses that are an order of magnitude below those of typical protoplanetary disks. We find a positive correlation between dip depth and WISE-2 (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer-2) excess, which we interpret as evidence that the dipper phenomenon is related to occulting structures in the inner disk, although this is difficult to reconcile with the weakly accreting aperiodic dippers. We consider three mechanisms to explain the dipper phenomenon: inner disk warps near the co-rotation radius related to accretion; vortices at the inner disk edge produced by the Rossby Wave Instability; and clumps of circumstellar material related to
planetesimal formation.},

precision of the light curves. We develop a fast regularization scheme
for pixel-level decorrelation (PLD) and adapt the algorithm to include
the PLD vectors of other stars to enhance the predictive power of the
model and minimize overfitting, particularly for faint stars. We also
modify PLD to work for saturated stars and improve its performance on
variable stars, although some high-frequency variables may still suffer
from overfitting. On average, EVEREST 2.0 light curves have 10-20\%
higher photometric precision than those in version 1, yielding the
highest-precision light curves at all \{Kp\} magnitudes of any publicly
available K2 catalog. For most K2 campaigns, we recover the original
Kepler precision to at least \{Kp\} = 14, and to at least \{Kp\} = 15 for
campaigns 1, 5, 6, and 13. We also detrend most short-cadence targets
observed by K2, obtaining even higher photometric precision for these
stars. Like all aggressive, flexible models, EVEREST is prone to
overfitting, and may cause a decrease in transit depths by ∼10\% we
urge users to mask signals of interest using our open-source software,
which we show removes this bias. Light curves for campaigns 0-8 and
10-13 are available online in the EVEREST catalog, which will be updated
with future campaigns. EVEREST 2.0 is open source and is coded in a
framework that can be adapted to other photometric surveys, including

EVEREST employs a variant of pixel level decorrelation to remove systematics introduced by the spacecraft’s pointing error and a Gaussian process to capture astrophysical
variability. We apply EVEREST to all K2 targets in campaigns 0-7, yielding light curves with precision comparable to that of the original Kepler mission for stars brighter than \{K\}p≈ 13, and
within a factor of two of the Kepler precision for fainter targets. We perform cross-validation and transit injection and recovery tests to validate the pipeline, and compare our light curves to the other de-trended light curves available for download at the MAST High Level Science Products archive. We find that EVEREST achieves the highest average precision of any of these pipelines for unsaturated K2 stars. The improved precision of these light curves will aid in exoplanet detection and characterization, investigations of stellar variability, asteroseismology, and other photometric studies. The EVEREST pipeline can also easily be applied to future surveys, such as the TESS mission, to correct for instrumental systematics and enable the detection of low signal-to-noise transiting exoplanets.

	abstract = {We use the Robo-AO survey of Kepler planetary candidate host stars, the largest adaptive optics survey yet performed, to measure the recovery rate of close stellar binaries in Gaia DR2. We find that Gaia recovers binaries down to 1" at magnitude contrasts as large as 6; closer systems are not resolved, regardless of secondary brightness. Gaia DR2 binary detection does not have a strong dependence on the orientation of the stellar pairs. We find 177 nearby stars to Kepler planetary candidate host stars in Gaia DR2 that were not detected in the Robo-AO survey, almost all of which are faint (G{\textgreater}20); the remainder were largely targets observed by Robo-AO in poor conditions. If the primary star is the host, the impact on the radii estimates of planet candidates in these systems is likely minimal; many of these faint stars, however, could be faint eclipsing binaries that are the source of a false positive planetary transit signal. With Robo-AO and Gaia combined, we find that 18.7\% of Kepler planet candidate hosts have nearby stars within 4". We also find 36 nearby stars in Gaia DR2 around 35 planetary candidate host stars detected with K2. The nearby star fraction rate for K2 planetary candidates is significantly lower than that for the primary Kepler mission. The binary recovery rate of Gaia will improve initial radius estimates of future TESS planet candidates significantly, however ground-based high-resolution follow-up observations are still needed for precise characterization and confirmation. The sensitivity of Gaia to closely separated binaries is expected to improve in later data releases.},

parent sample of young stellar objects (YSOs) with infrared (IR)
excesses indicative of warm circumstellar material or photometric
variability at optical wavelengths across the full 420 square degree
extent of the OSFC. When restricted to YSO candidates with H {\textless} 12.4,
to ensure S/N ∼ 100 for a six-visit source, this uniformly selected
sample includes 1307 IR excess sources selected using criteria vetted by
Koenig \& Liesawitz (2014) and 990 optical variables identified in
the Pan-STARRS1 3π survey: 319 sources exhibit both optical
variability and evidence of circumstellar disks through IR excess.
Objects from this uniformly selected sample received the highest
priority for targeting, but required fewer than half of the fibers on
each APOGEE-2 plate. We filled the remaining fibers with previously
confirmed and new color-magnitude selected candidate OSFC members.
Radial velocity measurements from APOGEE-1 and new APOGEE-2 observations

mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gas distributions between z∼
0.6 and 3.5 to constrain cosmology using baryon acoustic oscillations,
redshift space distortions, and the shape of the power spectrum. Within
eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: the SPectroscopic
IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-ray AGNs
and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey
(TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5
m Sloan Foundation Telescope at the Apache Point Observatory;
observations there began in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second
near-infrared spectrograph at the 2.5 m du Pont Telescope at Las
Campanas Observatory, with observations beginning in early 2017.
Observations at both facilities are scheduled to continue through 2020.
In keeping with previous SDSS policy, SDSS-IV provides regularly
scheduled public data releases; the first one, Data Release 13, was made
available in 2016 July.},

fiber-fed double spectrographs. Novel features of the telescope include the following: (1) A 3° diameter (0.65 m) focal plane that has
excellent image quality and small geometric distortions over a wide wavelength range (3000-10,600 Å) in the imaging mode, and good
image quality combined with very small lateral and longitudinal color errors in the spectroscopic mode. The unusual requirement of very low distortion is set by the demands of time-delay-and-integrate (TDI) imaging. (2) Very high precision motion to support open-loop TDI observations. (3) A unique wind baffle/enclosure construction to maximize image quality and minimize construction costs. The telescope had first light in 1998 May and began regular survey operations in 2000.},

FLAMINGOS on the KPNO 2.1 m and 4 m telescopes, we have obtained spectra

J- and H-band water absorption features. Derived spectral types range
from {\textasciitilde}M1 to later than M8 with typical classification errors of 0.5-1
subclasses. By combining these spectral types with JHK photometry, we
place these objects on the H-R diagram and use pre-main-sequence
evolutionary models to infer masses and ages. The mean age for this
low-mass population of NGC 2024 is 0.5 Myr, and derived masses range
from {\textasciitilde}0.7 to 0.02 Msolar with 23 objects falling below the
hydrogen-burning limit. The logarithmic mass function rises to a peak at
{\textasciitilde}0.2 Msolar before turning over and declining into the
substellar regime. There is a possible secondary peak at {\textasciitilde}0.035
Msolar however, the errors are also consistent with a flat
IMF in this region. The ratio of brown dwarfs to stars is similar to
that found in the Trapezium but roughly twice the ratio found in IC 348,
leading us to conclude that the substellar IMF in young clusters may be
dependent on the local star-forming environment.},

	abstract = {Low-mass stars (0.1 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} M {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1 solar mass) in OB associations are key to addressing some of the most fundamental problems in star
formation. The low-mass stellar populations of OB associations provide a snapshot of the fossil star-formation record of giant molecular cloud complexes. Large-scale surveys have identified hundreds of members of nearby OB associations, and revealed that low-mass stars exist wherever high-mass stars have recently formed. The spatial distribution of low-mass members of OB associations demonstrate the existence of significant substructure ("subgroups"). This "discretized" sequence of stellar groups is consistent with an origin in short-lived parent molecular clouds within a giant molecular cloud complex. The lowmass population in each subgroup within an OB association exhibits little evidence for significant age spreads on timescales of {\textasciitilde}10 m.y. or greater, in agreement with a scenario of rapid star formation and cloud dissipation. The initial mass function (IMF) of the stellar populations in OB associations in the mass range 0.1 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} M {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1 solar mass is largely consistent with the field IMF, and most low-mass
pre-main-sequence stars in the solar vicinity are in OB associations. These findings agree with early suggestions that the majority of stars in the galaxy were born in OB associations. The most recent work further suggests that a significant fraction of the stellar population may have their origin in the more spread out regions of OB associations, instead of all being born in dense clusters. Groundbased and spacebased (Spitzer Space Telescope) infrared studies have provided robust evidence that primordial accretion disks around low-mass stars dissipate on timescales of a few million years. However, on close inspection there appears to be great variance in the disk dissipation timescales for stars of a given mass in OB associations. While some stars appear to lack disks at {\textasciitilde}1 m.y., a few appear to retain accretion disks up to ages of {\textasciitilde}10-20 m.y.},

Our focus is mapping and characterizing the off-cloud, low-mass, pre-main-sequence (PMS) populations. We report 2062 K- and M-type confirmed T Tauri members; 59\% are located in the OB1a subassociation, 27\% in the OB1b subassociation, and the remaining 14\% in the A and B molecular clouds. We characterize two new clusterings of T Tauri stars, the HD 35762 and HR 1833 groups, both located in OB1a not far from the 25 Ori cluster. We also identify two stellar overdensities in OB1b, containing 231 PMS stars, and find that the OB1b region is composed of two populations at different distances, possibly due to the OB1a subassociation overlapping with the front of OB1b. A ̃2 deg wide halo of young stars surrounds the Orion Nebula Cluster, corresponding in part to the low-mass populations of NGC 1977 and NGC 1980. We use the strength of Hα in emission, combined with the IR excess and optical variability, to define a new type of T Tauri star, the C/W class, stars we propose may be nearing the end of their accretion phase, in an evolutionary state between classical and weak-lined T Tauri stars. The evolution of the ensemble-wide equivalent width of Li I λ6707 indicates a Li depletion timescale of ̃8.5 Myr. Disk accretion declines with an e-folding timescale of ̃2 Myr, consistent with previous studies.

The repurposed Kepler mission K2 is providing the first sample of young transiting planets by observing populations of stars in nearby, young clusters or stellar associations. We report the detection and confirmation of two planets transiting EPIC 211964830, an M2.5 dwarf in the 650 Myr old Praesepe open cluster. Using our notch-filter search method on the K2 lightcurve, we identify planets with periods of 5.84 d and 19.66 d. This is currently the second known multi-transit system in open clusters younger than 1 Gyr. The inner planet has a radius of 2.27\$\_\{-0.16\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.20\}\$ R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ and the outer planet has a radius of 2.77\$\_\{-0.18\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.20\}\$ R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$. Both planets are likely mini-Neptunes. These planets are expected to produce radial velocity signals of 3.4 and 2.7 m/s respectively, which is smaller than the expected stellar variability in the optical (\${\textbackslash}simeq\$30{\textbackslash},m/s), making mass measurements unlikely in the optical, but possible with future near-infrared spectrographs. We use an injection-recovery test to place robust limits on additional planets in the system, and find that planets larger than 1-2 R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ with periods of 1-20 d are unlikely, while planets larger than 2 R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ are ruled out at periods of 20-30 d.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05467},
	abstract = {For stars with unresolved companions, motions of the centre of light and that of mass decouple, causing a single-source astrometric model to perform poorly. We show that such stars can be easily detected with the reduced chi2 statistic, or RUWE, provided as part of Gaia DR2. We convert RUWE into the amplitude of the image centroid wobble, which, if scaled by the source distance, is proportional to the physical separation between companions (for periods up to several years). We test this idea on a sample of known spectroscopic binaries and demonstrate that the amplitude of the centroid perturbation scales with the binary period and the mass ratio as expected. We apply this technique to the Gaia DR2 data and show how the binary fraction evolves across the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram. The observed incidence of unresolved companions is high for massive young stars and drops steadily with stellar mass, reaching its lowest levels for white dwarfs. We highlight the elevated binary fraction for the nearby Blue Stragglers and Blue Horizontal Branch stars. We also illustrate how unresolved hierarchical triples inflate the relative velocity signal in wide binaries. Finally, we point out a hint of evidence for the existence of additional companions to the hosts of extrasolar hot jupiters.},

	abstract = {We report here on the photometric and kinematic properties of a well-defined group of nearly 200 low-mass pre-main-sequence stars, concentrated within {\textasciitilde}1° of the early-B star 25 Ori, in the Orion OB1a subassociation. We refer to this stellar aggregate as the 25 Orionis group. The group also harbors the Herbig Ae/Be star V346 Ori and a dozen other early-type stars with photometry, parallaxes, and some with IR excess emission, indicative of group membership. The number of high- and low-mass stars is in agreement with expectations from a standard initial mass function. The velocity distribution for the low-mass stars shows a narrow peak at 19.7 km s-1, offset {\textasciitilde}-10 km s-1 from the velocity characterizing the younger stars of the Ori OB1b subassociation, and -4 km s-1 from the velocity of widely spread young stars of the Ori OB1a population; this result provides new and compelling evidence that the 25 Ori group is a distinct kinematic entity, and that considerable space and velocity structure is present in the Ori OB1a subassociation. The low-mass members follow a well-defined band in the color-magnitude diagram, consistent with an isochronal age of {\textasciitilde}7-10 Myr. The {\textasciitilde}2 time drop in the overall Li I equivalent widths and accretion fraction between the younger Ori OB1b and the 25 Ori group is consistent with the latter being significantly older. In a simple-minded kinematic evolution scenario, the 25 Ori group may represent the evolved counterpart of the younger σ Ori cluster. The 25 Ori stellar aggregate is the most
populous {\textasciitilde}10 Myr sample yet known within 500 pc, setting it as an excellent laboratory to study the evolution of solar-like stars and protoplanetary disks.

	abstract = {We present results of a large-scale, multiepoch optical survey of the 
Orion OB1 association, carried out with the QUEST camera at the
Venezuela National Astronomical Observatory. We identify for the first
time the widely spread low-mass, young population in the Ori OB1a and
OB1b subassociations. Candidate members were picked up by their
variability in the V band and position in color-magnitude diagrams. We
obtained spectra to confirm membership. In a region spanning {\textasciitilde}68
deg2, we found 197 new young stars; of these, 56 are located
in the Ori OB1a subassociation and 141 in Ori OB1b. The spatial
distribution of the low-mass young stars is spatially coincident with
that of the high-mass members but suggests a much sharper edge to the
association. Comparison with the spatial extent of molecular gas and
extinction maps indicates that the subassociation Ori OB1b is
concentrated within a ringlike structure of radius {\textasciitilde}2°({\textasciitilde}15 pc at 440
pc), centered roughly on the star ɛ Ori in the Orion belt. The
ring is apparent in 13CO and corresponds to a region with an
extinction AV{\textgreater}=1. The stars exhibiting strong Hα
emission, an indicator of active accretion, are found along this ring,
whereas the center is populated with weak Hα-emitting stars. In
contrast, Ori OB1a is located in a region devoid of gas and dust. We
identify a grouping of stars within a {\textasciitilde}3 deg2 area located in
Ori OB1a, roughly clustered around the B2 star 25 Ori. The Herbig Ae/Be
star V346 Ori is also associated with this grouping, which could be an
older analog of σ Ori. Using several sets of evolutionary tracks,
we find an age of 7-10 Myr for Ori OB1a and of {\textasciitilde}4-6 Myr for Ori OB1b,
consistent with previous estimates from OB stars. Indicators such as the
equivalent width of Hα and near-IR excesses show that the number
of accreting low-mass stars decreases sharply between Ori OB1b and Ori
OB1a. These results indicate that although a substantial fraction of
accreting disks remain at ages {\textasciitilde}5 Myr, inner disks are essentially
dissipated by 10 Myr.

Methods: The validation was mainly carried out using an internal analysis of the photometry. External comparisons were also made, but were limited by the precision and systematics that may be present in the external catalogues used. Results: In addition to the photometric quality assessment, we present the best estimates of the three photometric passbands. Various colour-colour transformations are also derived to enable the users to convert between the Gaia and commonly used passbands. Conclusions: The internal analysis of the data shows that the photometric calibrations can reach a precision as low as 2 mmag on individual CCD measurements. Other tests show that systematic effects are present in the data at the 10 mmag level.},

About 24\% of the sample has multiple, real frequencies in the periodogram, sometimes manifesting as obvious beating in the LCs. Those having complex and/or structured periodogram peaks, unresolved multiple periods, and resolved close multiple periods are likely due to spot/spot group evolution and/or latitudinal differential rotation; these largely compose the slowly rotating sequence in P versus (V - K {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}){\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} identified in Paper I.

association. These dimming events are variable in depth, duration, and morphology. High spatial resolution imaging revealed that the star is single and radial velocity monitoring indicated that the dimming events cannot be due to an eclipsing stellar or brown dwarf companion. Archival and follow-up photometry suggest the dimming events are transient in nature. The variable morphology of the dimming events suggests they are not due to a single spherical body. The ingress of each dimming event is always shallower than egress, as one would expect for an orbiting body with a leading tail. The dimming events are periodic and synchronous with the stellar rotation. However, we argue it is unlikely the dimming events could be attributed to anything on the stellar surface based on the observed depths and durations. Variable obscuration by a
protoplanetary disk is unlikely on the basis that the star is not actively accreting and lacks the infrared excess associated with an inner disk. Rather, we explore the possibilities that the dimming events are due to magnetospheric clouds, a transiting protoplanet surrounded by circumplanetary dust and debris, eccentric orbiting bodies undergoing periodic tidal disruption, or an extended field of dust or debris near the corotation radius.},

M stars in the young USco region rotate systematically faster than GK stars, a pattern also present in K2 data for the older Pleiades and Praesepe systems. At higher masses (types FGK), the well-defined period-color relationship for slowly rotating stars seen in the Pleiades and Praesepe systems is not yet present in USco. Circumstellar disks are present predominantly among the more slowly rotating M stars in USco, with few disks in the subday rotators. However, M dwarfs with disks rotate faster on average than FGK systems with disks. For four of these disked M dwarfs, we provide direct evidence for disk locking based on the K2 LC morphologies. Our preliminary analysis shows a relatively mass-independent spin-up by a factor of ̃3.5 between USco and the Pleiades, then mass-dependent spin-down between Pleiades and Praesepe.},

	abstract = {We identify nine young stellar objects (YSOs) in the NGC 2264 
star-forming region with optical CoRoT light curves exhibiting
short-duration, shallow periodic flux dips. All of these stars have
infrared excesses that are consistent with their having inner disk walls
near the Keplerian co-rotation radius. The repeating photometric dips
have FWHMs generally less than 1 day, depths almost always less than
15\%, and periods (3 {\textless} P {\textless} 11 days) consistent with dust near the
Keplerian co-rotation period. The flux dips vary considerably in their
depth from epoch to epoch, but usually persist for several weeks and, in
two cases, were present in data collected in successive years. For
several of these stars, we also measure the photospheric rotation period
and find that the rotation and dip periods are the same, as predicted by
standard “disk-locking” models. We attribute these flux dips
to clumps of material in or near the inner disk wall, passing through
our line of sight to the stellar photosphere. In some cases, these dips
are also present in simultaneous Spitzer IRAC light curves at 3.6 and
4.5 microns. We characterize the properties of these dips, and compare
the stars with light curves exhibiting this behavior to other classes of
YSOs in NGC 2264. A number of physical mechanisms could locally increase
the dust scale height near the inner disk wall, and we discuss several
of those mechanisms; the most plausible mechanisms are either a disk
warp due to interaction with the stellar magnetic field or dust
entrained in funnel-flow accretion columns arising near the inner disk
wall.

Many of these K2 targets show two distinct periods, and for the lowest-mass stars in these clusters, virtually all of these systems with two periods are photometric binaries. The most likely explanation is that we are detecting the rotation periods for both components of these binaries. We explore the evolution of the rotation rate in both components of photometric binaries relative to one another and to nonphotometric binary stars. In Upper Sco and the Pleiades, these low-mass binary stars have periods that are much shorter on average and much closer to each other than would be true if drawn at random from the M dwarf single stars. In Upper Sco, this difference correlates strongly with the presence or absence of infrared excesses due to primordial circumstellar disks—the single-star population includes many stars with disks, and their rotation periods are distinctively longer on average than their binary star cousins of the same mass. By Praesepe age, the significance of the difference in rotation rate between the single and binary low-mass M dwarf stars is much less, suggesting that angular momentum loss from winds for fully convective zero-age main-sequence stars erases memory of the rotation rate dichotomy for binary and single very low mass stars at later ages.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of K2 light curves (LCs) from Campaigns 4 and 13 for
members of the young (\${\textbackslash}sim\$3 Myr) Taurus association, in addition to an older
(\${\textbackslash}sim\$30 Myr) population of stars that is largely in the foreground of the
Taurus molecular clouds. Out of 156 of the highest-confidence Taurus members,
we find that 81{\textbackslash}\% are periodic. Our sample of young foreground stars is biased
and incomplete, but nearly all (37/38) are periodic. The overall distribution
of rotation rates as a function of color (a proxy for mass) is similar to that
found in other clusters: the slowest rotators are among the early M spectral
types, with faster rotation towards both earlier FGK and later M types. The
relationship between period and color/mass exhibited by older clusters such as
the Pleiades is already in place by Taurus age. The foreground population has
very few stars, but is consistent with the USco and Pleiades period
distributions. As found in other young clusters, stars with disks rotate on
average slower, and few with disks are found rotating faster than \${\textbackslash}sim\$2 d.
The overall amplitude of the light curves decreases with age and higher mass
stars have generally lower amplitudes than lower mass stars. Stars with disks
have on average larger amplitudes than stars without disks, though the physical
mechanisms driving the variability and the resulting light curve morphologies
are also different between these two classes.},

CVSO30c were an L0 substellar object as suggested by previous studies.
The optical/infrared colors of CVSO30c are indicative of a stellar, not
substellar object, while the object’s color-magnitude

low-mass member of 25 Ori. Broadband photometry for CVSO30c is instead
better fit by contaminants such as a background K3 giant or M subdwarf.

	doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201526326},
	abstract = {Context. Direct imaging has developed into a very successful technique 
for the detection of exoplanets in wide orbits, especially around young
stars. Directly imaged planets can be both followed astrometrically on
their orbits and observed spectroscopically and thus provide an
essential tool for our understanding of the early solar system. 
Aims: We surveyed the 25 Ori association for direct-imaging companions.
This association has an age of only few million years. Among other
targets, we observed CVSO 30, which has recently been identified as the
first T Tauri star found to host a transiting planet candidate. 
Methods: We report on photometric and spectroscopic high-contrast
observations with the Very Large Telescope, the Keck telescopes, and the
Calar Alto observatory. They reveal a directly imaged planet candidate
close to the young M3 star CVSO 30. Results: The JHK-band
photometry of the newly identified candidate is at better than 1σ
consistent with late-type giants, early-T and early-M dwarfs, and
free-floating planets. Other hypotheses such as galaxies can be excluded
at more than 3.5σ. A lucky imaging z' photometric detection limit
z' = 20.5 mag excludes early-M dwarfs and results in less than 10
MJup for CVSO 30 c if bound. We present spectroscopic
observations of the wide companion that imply that the only remaining
explanation for the object is that it is the first very young ({\textless}10
Myr) L - T-type planet bound to a star, meaning that it appears bluer
than expected as a result of a decreasing cloud opacity at low effective
temperatures. Only a planetary spectral model is consistent with the
spectroscopy, and we deduce a best-fit mass of 4-5 Jupiter masses (total
range 0.6-10.2 Jupiter masses). Conclusions: This means that CVSO
30 is the first system in which both a close-in and a wide planet
candidate are found to have a common host star. The orbits of the two
possible planets could not be more different: they have orbital periods
of 10.76 h and about 27 000 yr. The two orbits may have formed during a
mutual catastrophic event of planet-planet scattering.

In this work, we uncover a signal using recently released data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which we show corresponds to time-variable reflection from a terrestrial planet with a rotation period of 0.9972696 days. Using a spherical harmonic-based reflection model developed as an extension of the STARRY package, we are able to reconstruct the surface features of this rocky world. We recover a time-variable albedo map of the planet including persistent regions which we interpret as oceans and cloud banks indicative of continental features. We argue that this planet represents the most promising detection of a habitable world to date, although the potential intelligence of any life on it is yet to be determined.},

By applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm to the six-dimensional stellar data, we identify spatially and/or kinematically distinct groups of young stellar objects with ages ranging from 1 to 12 Myr. We also investigate the star-forming history within the Orion Complex and identify peculiar subclusters. With this method we reconstruct the older populations in the regions that are currently largely devoid of molecular gas, such as Orion C (which includes the σ Ori cluster) and Orion D (the population that traces Ori OB1a, OB1b, and Orion X). We report on the distances, kinematics, and ages of the groups within the Complex. The Orion D group is in the process of expanding. On the other hand, Orion B is still in the process of contraction. In λ Ori the proper motions are consistent with a radial expansion due to an explosion from a supernova; the traceback age from the expansion exceeds the age of the youngest stars formed near the outer edges of the region, and their formation would have been triggered when they were halfway from the cluster center to their current positions. We also present a comparison between the parallax and proper-motion solutions obtained by Gaia DR2 and those obtained toward star-forming regions by the Very Long Baseline Array.},

The availability of the high-quality data has enabled astrophysical studies not possible before, including, for example, detailed
asteroseismic investigations and the study of the exoplanet census including small planets. This has also allowed to study the minute photometric variability following the orbital motion in stellar binaries and star-planet systems which is the subject of this review. We focus on systems with a main sequence primary and a low-mass secondary, from a small star to a massive planet. The orbital modulations are induced by a combination of gravitational and atmospheric processes, including the beaming effect, tidal ellipsoidal distortion, reflected light, and thermal emission. Therefore, the phase curve shape contains information about the companion’s mass and atmospheric characteristics, making phase curves a useful astrophysical tool. For example, phase curves can be used to detect and measure the mass of short-period low-mass
companions orbiting hot fast-rotating stars out of reach of other detection methods. Another interesting application of phase curves is using the orbital phase modulations to look for non-transiting systems, which comprise the majority of stellar binary and star-planet systems. We discuss the science done with phase curves, the first results obtained so far, and the current difficulties and open questions related to this young and evolving subfield.},

Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

	least-squares spectrum of gaussian noise, the reduction in the sum of squares at a particular frequency is a chi2-squared variable. The reductions at different frequencies are not independent, as there is a correlation between the height of the spectrum at any two frequencies, f1 and f2, which is equal to the mean height of the spectrum due to a sinusoidal signal of frequency f1, at the frequency f2. These correlations reduce the distortion in the spectrum of a signal affected by noise. Some numerical illustrations of the properties of least-squares frequency spectra are given.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the multiband periodogram, a general extension of the well-known Lomb–Scargle approach for detecting periodic signals in time-domain data. In addition to advantages of the Lomb–Scargle method such as treatment of non-uniform sampling and heteroscedastic errors, the multiband periodogram significantly improves period finding for randomly sampled multiband light curves (e.g., Pan-STARRS, DES, and LSST). The light curves in each band are modeled as arbitrary truncated Fourier series, with the period and phase shared across all bands. The key aspect is the use of Tikhonov regularization which drives most of the variability into the so-called base model common to all bands, while fits for individual bands describe residuals relative to the base model and typically require lower-order Fourier series. This decrease in the effective model complexity is the main reason for improved performance. After a pedagogical development of the formalism of least-squares spectral analysis, which motivates the essential features of the multiband model, we use simulated light curves and randomly subsampled SDSS Stripe 82 data to demonstrate the superiority of this method compared to other methods from the literature and find that this method will be able to efficiently determine the correct period in the majority of LSST’s bright RR Lyrae stars with as little as six months of LSST data, a vast improvement over the years of data reported to be required by previous studies. A Python implementation of this method, along with code to fully reproduce the results reported here, is available on GitHub.},

Previous work by van Eyken et al. and Barnes et al. predicts that the stellar rotation axis and the planetary orbital plane should precess with a period of 300–600 days. As a consequence, the observed transits should change shape and depth, disappear, and reappear with the precession. Our observations indicate the long-term presence of the transit events ( years), and that the transits indeed do change depth, disappear and reappear. The Spitzer observations and the NIRSPEC radial velocity observations (with contemporaneous LCOGT optical light curve data) are consistent with the predicted transit times and depths for the precession model and demonstrate the disappearance of the transits. An LCOGT optical light curve shows that the transits do reappear approximately 1 year later. The observed transits occur at the times predicted by a straight-forward propagation of the transit ephemeris. The precession model correctly predicts the depth and time of the Spitzer transit and the lack of a transit at the time of the NIRSPEC radial velocity observations. However, the precession model predicts the return of the transits approximately 1 month later than observed by LCOGT. Overall, the data are suggestive that the planetary interpretation of the observed transit events may indeed be correct, but the precession model and data are currently insufficient to confirm firmly the planetary status of PTFO 8-8695b.},

period Porb of 0.448 d and the stellar spin period
Ps of less than 0.671 d are unusually short, which makes PTFO
8-8695 an ideal system to check the model of gravity darkening and nodal
precession. While the previous analysis of PTFO 8-8695 assumed that the
stellar spin and planetary orbital periods are the same, we extend the

three different classes of solutions roughly corresponding to the nodal
precession periods of 199 ± 16, 475 ± 21, and 827 ±

We compare the predicted light curves of the three solutions against the

	abstract = {PTFO 8-8695b represents the first transiting exoplanet candidate orbiting a pre-main-sequence star (van Eyken et al. 2012, ApJ, 755, 42). We find that the unusual lightcurve shapes of PTFO 8-8695 can be explained by transits of a planet across an oblate, gravity-darkened stellar disk. We develop a theoretical framework for understanding precession of a planetary orbit's ascending node for the case when the stellar rotational angular momentum and the planetary orbital angular momentum are comparable in magnitude. We then implement those ideas to simultaneously and self-consistently fit two separate lightcurves observed in 2009 December and 2010 December. Our two self-consistent fits yield M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 3.0 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 3.6 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} for assumed stellar masses of M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.34 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.44 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} respectively. The two fits have precession periods of 293 days and 581 days. These mass determinations (consistent with previous upper limits) along with the strength of the gravity-darkened precessing model together validate PTFO 8-8695b as just the second hot Jupiter known to orbit an M-dwarf. Our fits show a high degree of spin-orbit misalignment in the PTFO 8-8695 system: 69° ± 2° or 73.°1 ± 0.°5, in the two cases. The large misalignment is consistent with the hypothesis that planets become hot Jupiters with random orbital plane alignments early in a system's lifetime. We predict that as a result of the highly misaligned, precessing system, the transits should disappear for months at a time over the course of the system's precession period. The precessing, gravity-darkened model also predicts other observable effects: changing orbit inclination that could be detected by radial velocity observations, changing stellar inclination that would manifest as varying vsin i, changing projected spin-orbit alignment that could be seen by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, changing transit shapes over the course of the precession, and differing lightcurves as a function of wavelength. Our measured planet radii of 1.64 R {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and 1.68 R {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} in each case are consistent with a young, hydrogen-dominated planet that results from a "hot-start" formation mechanism.},

Transient Factory (PTF) Orion project. It has a photometric transit
period of 0.448413 ± 0.000040 days, and appears in both 2009 and
2010 PTF data. Follow-up low-precision radial velocity (RV) observations
and adaptive optics imaging suggest that the star is not an eclipsing
binary, and that it is unlikely that a background source is blended with
the target and mimicking the observed transit. RV observations with the
Hobby-Eberly and Keck telescopes yield an RV that has the same period as
the photometric event, but is offset in phase from the transit center by
≈ - 0.22 periods. The amplitude (half range) of the RV variations is
2.4 km s-1 and is comparable with the expected RV amplitude
that stellar spots could induce. The RV curve is likely dominated by
stellar spot modulation and provides an upper limit to the projected
companion mass of M psin i orb {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 4.8 ±
1.2 M Jup; when combined with the orbital inclination, i
orb, of the candidate planet from modeling of the transit
light curve, we find an upper limit on the mass of the planetary
candidate of M p {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 5.5 ± 1.4 M Jup.
This limit implies that the planet is orbiting close to, if not inside,
its Roche limiting orbital radius, so that it may be undergoing active
mass loss and evaporation.},

We observed 28 fading events spread over several years and did not see the expected changes. Instead, we found that the fading events are not strictly periodic. Second, we attempted to detect the planet's radiation, based on infrared observations spanning the predicted times of occultations. We ruled out a signal of the expected amplitude. Third, we attempted to detect the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect by performing high-resolution spectroscopy throughout a fading event. No effect was seen at the expected level, ruling out most (but not all) possible orientations for the hypothetical planetary orbit. Our spectroscopy also revealed strong, time-variable, high-velocity Hα and Ca H \& K emission features. All these observations cast doubt on the planetary hypothesis, and suggest instead that the fading events represent starspots, eclipses by circumstellar dust, or occultations of an accretion hotspot.},

The inner companion, CVSO 30 b, is the first possible young transiting planet orbiting a previously known weak-lined T Tauri star. With five telescopes of the `Young Exoplanet Transit Initiative' located in Asia, Europe and South America, we monitored CVSO 30 over three years in a total of 144 nights and detected 33 fading events. In two more seasons we carried out follow-up
observations with three telescopes. We can confirm that there is a change in the shape of the fading event between different observations and that the fading event even disappears and reappears. A total of 38 fading event light curves were simultaneously modelled. We derived the planetary, stellar and geometrical properties of the system and found them slightly smaller but in agreement with the values from the
discovery paper. The period of the fading event was found to be 1.36 s shorter and 100 times more precise than the previous published value. If CVSO 30 b would be a giant planet on a precessing orbit, which we cannot confirm, yet, the precession period may be shorter than previously thought.

ESA-Gaia mission, in order to search for stellar companions of exoplanet
host stars, located at distances closer than about 500 pc around the
Sun. In total, 176 binaries, 27 hierarchical triples, and one
hierarchical quadruple system are detected among more than 1300
exoplanet host stars, whose multiplicity is investigated, yielding a
multiplicity rate of the exoplanet host stars of at least about 15 per
cent. The detected companions and the exoplanet host stars are
equidistant and share a common proper motion, as it is expected for
gravitationally bound stellar systems, proven with their accurate Gaia
astrometry. The companions exhibit masses in the range between about
0.078 and 1.4 M⊙ with a peak in their mass distribution
between 0.15 and 0.3 M\_\{⊙\}. The companions are separated from the
exoplanet host stars by about 20 up to 9100 au, but are found most
frequently within a projected separation of 1000 au. While most of the
detected companions are early M dwarfs, eight white dwarf companions of
exoplanet host stars are also identified in this survey, whose true
nature is revealed with their photometric properties. Hence, these
degenerated companions and the exoplanet host stars form evolved stellar
systems with exoplanets, which have survived (physically but also
dynamically) the post-main-sequence evolution of their former primary
star.},

perturbation. We select 84 Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) with gas

stellar population statistics. We find evidence of suppressive planet
formation within 20 AU by comparing stellar multiplicity. The stellar

\{0\}-0+5\% within 20 AU. In comparison, the stellar
MR is 18\% ± 2\% for the control sample, i.e., field stars in the

	abstract = {Almost half of the stellar systems in the solar neighborhood are made up 
of multiple stars. In multiple-star systems, planet formation is under
the dynamical influence of stellar companions, and the planet occurrence
rate is expected to be different from that of single stars. There have
been numerous studies on the planet occurrence rate of single star
systems. However, to fully understand planet formation, the planet
occurrence rate in multiple-star systems needs to be addressed. In this
work, we infer the planet occurrence rate in multiple-star systems by
measuring the stellar multiplicity rate for planet host stars. For a
subsample of 56 Kepler planet host stars, we use adaptive optics (AO)
imaging and the radial velocity (RV) technique to search for stellar
companions. The combination of these two techniques results in high
search completeness for stellar companions. We detect 59 visual stellar
companions to 25 planet host stars with AO data. Three stellar
companions are within 2'' and 27 within 6''. We also detect two possible
stellar companions (KOI 5 and KOI 69) showing long-term RV acceleration.
After correcting for a bias against planet detection in multiple-star
systems due to flux contamination, we find that planet formation is
suppressed in multiple-star systems with separations smaller than 1500
AU. Specifically, we find that compared to single star systems, planets
in multiple-star systems occur 4.5 ± 3.2, 2.6 ± 1.0, and
1.7 ± 0.5 times less frequently when a stellar companion is
present at a distance of 10, 100, and 1000 AU, respectively. This
conclusion applies only to circumstellar planets; the planet occurrence
rate for circumbinary planets requires further investigation.},

Using high angular resolution speckle imaging, we detect stellar companions within ∼1 arcsec of K2 planet-candidate host stars.

The large field of view, however, results in low spatial resolution; therefore, multiple stars contribute to almost every TESS light curve. High angular resolution imaging can detect the previously unknown companions to planetary candidate hosts that dilute the transit depths, lead to host star ambiguity, and, in some cases, are the source of false-positive transit signals. We use speckle imaging on the Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) telescope to search for companions to 542 TESS planet candidate hosts in the southern sky. We provide correction factors for the 117 systems with resolved companions due to photometric contamination. The contamination in TESS due to close binaries is similar to that found in surveys of Kepler planet candidates. For the solar-type population, we find a deep deficit of close binary systems with projected stellar separations less than 100 au among planet candidate hosts (44 observed binaries compared to 124 expected based on field binary statistics). The close binary suppression among TESS planet candidate hosts is similar to that seen for the more distant Kepler population. We also find a large surplus of TESS planet candidates in wide binary systems detected in both SOAR and Gaia DR2 (119 observed binaries compared to 77 expected). These wide binaries almost
exclusively host giant planets, however, suggesting that orbital migration caused by perturbations from the stellar companion may lead to planet–planet scattering and suppress the population of small
planets in wide binaries. Both trends are also apparent in the M dwarf planet candidate hosts.},

	abstract = {Stellar companions can influence the formation and evolution of 
planetary systems, but there are currently few observational constraints
on the properties of planet-hosting binary star systems. We search for
stellar companions around 77 transiting hot Jupiter systems to explore
the statistical properties of this population of companions as compared
to field stars of similar spectral type. After correcting for survey
incompleteness, we find that 47 \% +/- 7 \% of hot Jupiter systems have
stellar companions with semimajor axes between 50 and 2000 au. This is
2.9 times larger than the field star companion fraction in this
separation range, with a significance of 4.4σ . In the 1-50
au range, only \{3.9\}-2.0+4.5 \% of hot Jupiters
host stellar companions, compared to the field star value of 16.4 \% +/-
0.7 \% , which is a 2.7σ difference. We find that the distribution
of mass ratios for stellar companions to hot Jupiter systems peaks at
small values and therefore differs from that of field star binaries
which tend to be uniformly distributed across all mass ratios. We
conclude that either wide separation stellar binaries are more favorable
sites for gas giant planet formation at all separations, or that the
presence of stellar companions preferentially causes the inward
migration of gas giant planets that formed farther out in the disk via
dynamical processes such as Kozai-Lidov oscillations. We determine
that less than 20\% of hot Jupiters have stellar companions capable of
inducing Kozai-Lidov oscillations assuming initial semimajor axes
between 1 and 5 au, implying that the enhanced companion occurrence is
likely correlated with environments where gas giants can form
efficiently.},

	abstract = {Close binaries suppress the formation of circumstellar (S-type) planets and therefore significantly bias the inferred planet occurrence rates and statistical trends. After compiling various radial velocity and high-resolution imaging surveys, we determine that binaries with a {\textless} 1 au fully suppress S-type planets, binaries with a = 10 au host close planets at 15\% the occurrence rate of single stars, and wide binaries with a {\textgreater} 200 au have a negligible effect on planet formation. We show that F = 43\% +/- 6\% of solar-type primaries do not host close planets due to suppression by close stellar companions. By removing spectroscopic binaries from their samples, radial velocity surveys for giant planets boost their detection rates by a factor of 1/(1-F) = 1.8 +/- 0.2 compared to transiting surveys. This selection bias fully accounts for the discrepancy in hot Jupiter occurrence rates inferred from these two detection methods. Correcting for both planet suppression by close binaries and transit dilution by wide binaries, the occurrence rate of small planets orbiting single G-dwarfs is 2.1 +/- 0.3 times larger than the rate inferred from all G-dwarfs in the Kepler survey. About half (but not all) of the observed increase in small, short-period planets toward low-mass hosts can be explained by the corresponding decrease in the binary fraction. Finally, we demonstrate that the apparent enhancement of wide stellar companions to hot Jupiter hosts is due to multiple selection effects. Although very close binaries with secondary masses M\_2 {\textgreater} 10 M\_J preferentially have wide tertiary companions, genuine hot Jupiters with M\_p = 0.2-4 M\_J that formed via core accretion do not exhibit a statistically significant excess of wide stellar companions.},

Moderate eccentricities are detected for the inner orbits as well (e=\{0.34\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.07{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.08{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for Kepler-448b and e=\{0.2\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.1{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for Kepler-693b). In the Kepler-693 system, a large mutual inclination between the inner and outer orbits (\{53\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-9{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+7{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textbackslash}deg or \{134\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+11{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textbackslash}deg ) is also revealed by the TDVs. This is likely to induce a secular oscillation in the eccentricity of the inner WJ that brings its periastron close enough to the host star for tidal star-planet interactions to be significant. In the Kepler-448 system, the mutual inclination is weakly constrained, and such an eccentricity oscillation is possible for a fraction of the solutions. Thus these WJs may be undergoing tidal migration to become hot Jupiters (HJs), although the migration via this process from beyond the snow line is disfavored by the close-in and massive nature of the companions. This may indicate that WJs can be formed in situ and could even evolve into HJs via high-eccentricity migration inside the snow line.},

We develop a joint analysis of multi-colour photometry, centroids, radial velocity (RV) cross-correlation function (CCF) profiles and their bisector inverse slopes (BIS) to disentangle this three-body system. Data from the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS), SPECULOOS and HARPS are analysed and modelled with our new blendfitter software. We find that the binary consists of NGTS-3A (G6V-dwarf) and NGTS-3B (K1V-dwarf) at {\textless}1 arcsec separation. NGTS-3Ab orbits every P = 1.675 days. The planet radius and mass are R\_planet = 1.48+-0.37 R\_J and M\_planet = 2.38+-0.26 M\_J, suggesting it is potentially inflated. We emphasise that only combining all the information from multi-colour photometry, centroids and RV CCF profiles can resolve systems like NGTS-3. Such systems cannot be disentangled from single-colour photometry and RV measurements alone. Importantly, the presence of a BIS correlation indicates a blend scenario, but is not sufficient to determine which star is orbited by the third body. Moreover, even if no BIS correlation is detected, a blend scenario cannot be ruled out without further information. The choice of methodology for calculating the BIS can influence the measured significance of its correlation. The presented findings are crucial to consider for wide-field transit surveys, which require wide CCD pixels ({\textgreater}5 arcsec) and are prone to contamination by blended objects. With TESS on the horizon, it is pivotal for the candidate vetting to incorporate all available follow-up information from multi-colour photometry and RV CCF profiles.},

detected via radial velocity. The inner transiting planet, HATS-59b, is
on an eccentric orbit with e=0.129+/- 0.049, orbiting a V=13.951+/-
0.030 mag solar-like star (\{M\}{\textbackslash}star = 1.038+/- 0.039

outer companion, HATS-59c is on a circular orbit with m{\textbackslash}sin i=12.70 +/-
0.87 \{M\}\{\{J\}\} and a period of 1422 ± 14 days. The
inner planet has a mass of 0.806+/- 0.069 \{M\}\{\{J\}\} and a

to the transiting hot Jupiter, a massive outer companion. The
architecture of this system is valuable for understanding planet
migration.

The HATSouth network is operated by a collaboration consisting of
Princeton University (PU), the Max Planck Institute für Astronomie
(MPIA), the Australian National University (ANU), and the Pontificia
Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC). The station at Las Campanas

The orbit of HAT-P-11b is misaligned with the star’s spin—one of the few known cases of a misaligned planet orbiting a star less massive than the Sun. We find an additional planet in the system based on a decade of precision radial velocity (RV) measurements from Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer. HAT-P-11c is similar to Jupiter in its mass ( M J ) and orbital period ( year), but has a much more eccentric orbit (e = 0.60 ± 0.03). In our joint modeling of RV and stellar activity, we found an activity-induced RV signal of ∼7 , consistent with other active K dwarfs, but significantly smaller than the 31 reflex motion due to HAT-P-11c. We investigated the dynamical coupling between HAT-P-11b and c as a possible explanation for HAT-P-11b’s misaligned orbit, finding that planet–planet Kozai interactions cannot tilt planet b’s orbit due to general relativistic precession; however, nodal precession operating on million year timescales is a viable mechanism to explain HAT-P-11b’s high obliquity. This leaves open the question of why HAT-P-11c may have such a tilted orbit. At a distance of 38 pc, the HAT-P-11 system offers rich opportunities for further exoplanet characterization through astrometry and direct imaging.},

	abstract = {Theoretical calculations and some indirect observations show that 
massive exoplanets on tight orbits must decay due to tidal dissipation
within their host stars. This orbital evolution could be observationally
accessible through precise transit timing over a course of decades. The
rate of planetary in-spiraling may not only help us to understand some
aspects of evolution of planetary systems, but also can be used as a
probe of the stellar internal structure. In this paper we present
results of transit timing campaigns organized for a carefully selected
sample of the Northern hemisphere hot Jupiter-like planets which were
found to be the best candidates for detecting planet-star tidal
interactions. Among them, there is the WASP-12 system which is the best
candidate for possessing an in-falling giant exoplanet. Our new
observations support the scenario of orbital decay of WASP-12 b and
allow us to refine its rate. The derived tidal quality parameter of the
host star Q'*=(1.82±0.32)×105 is in
agreement with theoretical predictions for subgiant stars. For the
remaining systems - HAT-P-23, KELT-1, KELT-16, WASP-33, and WASP-103 -
our transit timing data reveal no deviations from the constant-period
models, hence constraints on the individual rates of orbital decay were
placed. The tidal quality parameters of host stars in at least four
systems - HAT-P-23, KELT-1, WASP-33, and WASP-103 - were found to be
greater than the value reported for WASP-12. This is in line with the
finding that those hosts are main sequence stars, for which efficiency
of tidal dissipation is predicted to be relatively weak.},

	abstract = {Many problems in contemporary astrophysics---from understanding the formation of black holes to untangling the chemical evolution of galaxies---rely on knowledge about binary stars. This, in turn, depends on discovery and characterization of binary companions for large numbers of different kinds of stars in different chemical and dynamical environments. Current stellar spectroscopic surveys observe hundreds of thousands to millions of stars with (typically) few observational epochs, which allows binary discovery but makes orbital characterization challenging. We use a custom Monte Carlo sampler (The Joker) to perform discovery and characterization of binary systems through radial-velocities, in the regime of sparse, noisy, and poorly sampled multi-epoch data. We use it to generate posterior samplings in Keplerian parameters for 232,531 sources released in APOGEE Data Release 16. Our final catalog contains 19,635 high-confidence close-binary (P {\textless} few years, a {\textless} few AU) systems that show interesting relationships between binary occurrence rate and location in the color-magnitude diagram. We find notable faint companions at high masses (black-hole candidates), at low masses (substellar candidates), and at very close separations (mass-transfer candidates). We also use the posterior samplings in a (toy) hierarchical inference to measure the long-period binary-star eccentricity distribution. We release the full set of posterior samplings for the entire parent sample of 232,531 stars. This set of samplings involves no heuristic "discovery" threshold and therefore can be used for myriad statistical purposes, including hierarchical inferences about binary-star populations and sub-threshold searches.},

	title = {A public {HARPS} radial velocity database corrected for systematic errors},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05942},
	abstract = {Context. The HARPS spectrograph provides state-of-the-art stellar radial velocity (RV) measurements with a precision down to 1 m/s. The spectra are extracted with a dedicated data-reduction software (DRS) and the RVs are computed by CCF with a numerical mask. Aims. The aim of this study is three-fold: (i) Create easy access to the public HARPS RV data set. (ii) Apply the new public SERVAL pipeline to the spectra, and produce a more precise RV data set. (iii) Check whether the precision of the RVs can be further improved by correcting for small nightly systematic effects. Methods. For each star observed with HARPS, we downloaded the publicly available spectra from the ESO archive and recomputed the RVs with SERVAL. We then computed nightly zero points (NZPs) by averaging the RVs of quiet stars. Results. Analysing the RVs of the most RV-quiet stars, whose RV scatter is {\textless} 5 m/s, we find that SERVAL RVs are on average more precise than DRS RVs by a few percent. We find three significant systematic effects, whose magnitude is independent of the software used for the RV derivation: (i) stochastic variations with a magnitude of 1 m/s; (ii) long-term variations, with a magnitude of 1 m/s and a typical timescale of a few weeks; and (iii) 20-30 NZPs significantly deviating by a few m/s. In addition, we find small ({\textless} 1 m/s) but significant intra-night drifts in DRS RVs before the 2015 intervention, and in SERVAL RVs after it. We confirm that the fibre exchange in 2015 caused a discontinuous RV jump, which strongly depends on the spectral type of the observed star: from 14 m/s for late F-type stars, to -3 m/s for M dwarfs. Conclusions. Our NZP-corrected SERVAL RVs can be retrieved from a user-friendly, public database. It provides more than 212 000 RVs for about 3000 stars along with many auxiliary information, NZP corrections, various activity indices, and DRS-CCF products.},

	abstract = {We present the results of a new series of nongray calculations of the atmospheres, spectra, colors, and evolution of extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) and brown dwarfs for effective temperatures below 1300 K. This theory encompasses most of the mass/age parameter space occupied by substellar objects and is the first spectral study down to 100 K. These calculations are in aid of the multitude of searches being conducted or planned around the world for giant planets and brown dwarfs and reveal the exotic nature of the class. Generically, absorption by H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} at longer wavelengths and H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}O opacity windows at shorter wavelengths conspire to redistribute flux blueward. Below 1200 K, methane is the dominant carbon bearing molecule and is a universal diagnostic feature of EGP and brown dwarf spectra. We find that the primary bands in which to search are Z ({\textasciitilde}1.05 μm), J ({\textasciitilde}1.2 μm), H ({\textasciitilde}1.6 μm), K ({\textasciitilde}2.2 μm), M ({\textasciitilde}5 μm), and N ({\textasciitilde}10 μm), that enhancements of the emergent flux over blackbody values, in particular in the near infrared, can be by many orders of magnitude, and that the infrared colors of EGPs and brown dwarfs are much bluer than previously believed. In particular, relative to J and H, the K band flux is reduced by CH{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} absorption. Furthermore, we conclude that for T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}'s below 1200 K most or all true metals may be sequestered below the photosphere, that an interior radiative zone is a generic feature of substellar objects, and that clouds of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}O and NH{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}3{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} are formed for T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}'s below {\textasciitilde}400 and {\textasciitilde}200 K, respectively. This study is done for solar-metallicity objects in isolation and does not include the effects of stellar insulation. Nevertheless, it is a comprehensive attempt to bridge the gap between the planetary and stellar realms and to develop a nongray theory of objects from 0.3M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (``Saturn'') to 70M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ({\textasciitilde}0.07 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}).

show that hot Jupiter host stars have a smaller Galactic velocity
dispersion than a similar population of stars without hot Jupiters.
Since Galactic velocity dispersion is correlated with age, this
observation implies that the population of hot Jupiter host stars is on
average younger than the field population. The best explanation for this
inference is that tidal interactions cause hot Jupiters to inspiral
while their host stars are on the main sequence. This observation
requires that the typical modified stellar tidal quality factor

the characteristics of extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs. Similar
indications can be obtained from the measurement of small astrometric
accelerations of the primary star, either from the ground or more likely
from future highly precise space astrometry missions. We show here that
a single measurement of the angular separation of such companions, if
they can be imaged directly, provides valuable statistical information
on their mass when combined with the accelerations. We derive the
probability distribution of the companion mass separately for the radial
velocity case and for the astrometric case by Monte Carlo simulations,
and illustrate the application of the technique with several examples.
The information on the masses of such wide substellar companions is
complementary to that from closer spectroscopic companions, and a full
analysis of the mass distribution of these objects should include both
to avoid possible biases.},

(HD 190406; GJ 779; 15 Sge). Three epochs of high-resolution imaging
using adaptive optics (AO) at the Gemini-North and Keck II Telescopes
demonstrate that HR 7672B is a common proper motion companion, with a
separation of 0.79" (14 AU) and a 2.16 μm flux ratio of 8.6 mag.
Using follow-up K-band spectroscopy from Keck AO+NIRSPEC, we measure a
spectral type of L45 with an uncertainty of +/-1.5 subclasses. This is
the closest ultracool companion around a main-sequence star found to
date by direct imaging. We estimate that the primary has an age of 1-3
Gyr. Assuming coevality, the companion is most likely substellar, with a
mass of 55-78 MJ based on theoretical models. The primary
star shows a long-term radial velocity trend, and we combine the radial
velocity data and AO imaging to set a firm (model-independent) lower
limit of 48 MJ. In contrast to the paucity of brown dwarf
companions at {\textless}{\textasciitilde}4 AU around FGK dwarfs, HR 7672B implies that brown
dwarf companions do exist at separations comparable to those of the
giant planets in our own solar system. Its presence is at variance with
scenarios in which brown dwarfs form as ejected stellar embryos.
Moreover, since HR 7672B is likely too massive to have formed in a
circumstellar disk as planets are believed to, its discovery suggests
that a diversity of physical processes act to populate the outer regions
of exoplanetary systems.},

I show that objects with orbit metal-rich solar-type dwarf stars, a property associated with core accretion. Objects with do not share this property. This transition is coincident with a minimum in the occurrence rate of such objects, suggesting that the maximum mass of a celestial body formed through core accretion like a planet is less than . Consequently, objects with orbiting solar-type dwarf stars likely formed through gravitational instability and should not be thought of as planets. Theoretical models of giant planet formation in scaled minimum-mass solar nebula Shakura–Sunyaev disks with standard parameters tuned to produce giant planets predict a maximum mass nearly an order of magnitude larger. To prevent newly formed giant planets from growing larger than , protoplanetary disks must therefore be significantly less viscous or of lower mass than typically assumed during the runaway gas accretion stage of giant planet formation. Either effect would act to slow the Type I/II migration of planetary embryos/giant planets and promote their survival. These inferences are insensitive to the host star mass, planet formation location, or characteristic disk dissipation time.},

	abstract = {We compile observations of early-type binaries identified via spectroscopy, eclipses, long-baseline interferometry, adaptive optics, common proper motion, etc. Each observational technique is sensitive to companions across a narrow parameter space of orbital periods P and mass ratios q = /M 1. After combining the samples from the various surveys and correcting for their respective selection effects, we find that the properties of companions to O-type and B-type main-sequence (MS) stars differ among three regimes. First, at short orbital periods P ≲ 20 days (separations a ≲ 0.4 au), the binaries have small eccentricities e ≲ 0.4, favor modest mass ratios , and exhibit a small excess of twins q {\textgreater} 0.95. Second, the companion frequency peaks at intermediate periods log P (days) ≈ 3.5 (a ≈ 10 au), where the binaries have mass ratios weighted toward small values q ≈ 0.2–0.3 and follow a Maxwellian “thermal” eccentricity distribution. Finally, companions with long orbital periods log P (days) ≈ 5.5–7.5 (a ≈ 200–5000 au) are outer tertiary components in hierarchical triples and have a mass ratio distribution across q ≈ 0.1–1.0 that is nearly consistent with random pairings drawn from the initial mass function. We discuss these companion distributions and properties in the context of binary-star formation and evolution. We also reanalyze the binary statistics of solar-type MS primaries, taking into account that 30\% ± 10\% of single-lined spectroscopic binaries likely contain white dwarf companions instead of low-mass stellar secondaries. The mean frequency of stellar companions with q {\textgreater} 0.1 and log P (days) {\textless} 8.0 per primary increases from 0.50 ± 0.04 for solar-type MS primaries to 2.1 ± 0.3 for O-type MS primaries. We fit joint probability density functions to the corrected distributions, which can be incorporated into binary population synthesis studies.},

to their mass from Doppler and astrometric measurements. In the near
future, it will be possible to construct three-dimensional orbits and
calculate the dynamical mass of HD 68017 B and possibly HD 71881 B. We
already detect astrometric orbital motion of HD 68017 B, which has a
projected separation of 13.0 AU. Each companion is amenable to
AO-assisted direct spectroscopy. Further, each companion orbits a
solar-type star, making it possible to infer metallicity and age from
the primary. Such benchmark objects are essential for testing

These stars, namely, HD 34445, HD 126614, HD 13931, and Gl 179, all show evidence for a single planet in Keplerian motion. We also present Doppler measurements from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) for two of the stars, HD 34445 and Gl 179, that confirm the Keck detections and significantly refine the orbital parameters. These planets add to the statistical properties of giant planets orbiting near or beyond the ice line, and merit follow-up by astrometry, imaging, and space-borne spectroscopy. Their orbital parameters span wide ranges of planetary minimum mass (M sin i = 0.38-1.9 M Jup), orbital period (P = 2.87-11.5 yr), semimajor axis (a = 2.1-5.2 AU), and eccentricity (e = 0.02-0.41). HD 34445 b (P = 2.87 yr, M sin i = 0.79 M Jup, e = 0.27) is a massive planet orbiting an old, G-type star. We announce a planet, HD 126614 Ab, and an M dwarf, HD 126614 B, orbiting the
metal-rich star HD 126614 (which we now refer to as HD 126614 A). The planet, HD 126614 Ab, has minimum mass M sin i = 0.38 M Jup and orbits the stellar primary with period P = 3.41 yr and orbital separation a = 2.3 AU. The faint M dwarf companion, HD 126614 B, is separated from the stellar primary by 489 mas (33 AU) and was discovered with direct observations using adaptive optics and the PHARO camera at Palomar Observatory. The stellar primary in this new system, HD 126614 A, has the highest measured metallicity ([Fe/H] = +0.56) of any known planet-bearing star. HD 13931 b (P = 11.5 yr, M sin i = 1.88 M
Jup, e = 0.02) is a Jupiter analog orbiting a near solar twin. Gl 179 b (P = 6.3 yr, M sin i = 0.82 M Jup, e = 0.21) is a massive planet orbiting a faint M dwarf. The high metallicity of Gl 179 is consistent with the planet-metallicity correlation among M dwarfs, as documented recently by Johnson \& Apps.

	abstract = {It is suggested that the distribution of orbital eccentricities for extrasolar planets is well described by the Beta distribution. Several properties of the Beta distribution make it a powerful tool for this purpose. For example, the Beta distribution can reproduce a diverse range of probability density functions (PDFs) using just two shape parameters (a and b). We argue that this makes it ideal for serving as a parametric model in Bayesian comparative population analysis. The Beta distribution is also uniquely defined over the interval zero to unity, meaning that it can serve as a proper prior for eccentricity when analysing the observations of bound extrasolar planets. Using nested sampling, we find that the distribution of eccentricities for 396 exoplanets detected through radial velocity with high signal-to-noise is well described by a Beta distribution with parameters a = 0.867+0.044−0.044−0.044+0.044\{{\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.044\}\_\{- 0.044\}\} and b = 3.03+0.17−0.16−0.16+0.17\{{\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.17\}\_\{- 0.16\}\}. The Beta distribution is shown to be 3.7 times more likely to represent the underlying distribution of exoplanet eccentricities than the next best model: a Rayleigh + exponential distribution. The same data are also used in an example population comparison utilizing the Beta distribution, where we find that the short- and long-period planets are described by distinct Beta distributions at a confidence of 11.6σ and display a signature consistent with the effects of tidal circularization.},

	abstract = {Doppler-based planet surveys have discovered numerous giant planets but 
are incomplete beyond several AU. At larger star-planet separations,
direct planet detection through high-contrast imaging has proven
successful, but this technique is sensitive only to young planets and
characterization relies upon theoretical evolution models. Here we
demonstrate that radial velocity measurements and high-contrast imaging
can be combined to overcome these issues. The presence of widely
separated companions can be deduced by identifying an acceleration
(long-term trend) in the radial velocity of a star. By obtaining high
spatial resolution follow-up imaging observations, we rule out scenarios
in which such accelerations are caused by stellar binary companions with
high statistical confidence. We report results from an analysis of
Doppler measurements of a sample of 111 M-dwarf stars with a median of
29 radial velocity observations over a median time baseline of 11.8 yr.
By targeting stars that exhibit a radial velocity acceleration ("trend")
with adaptive optics imaging, we determine that 6.5\% ± 3.0\% of
M-dwarf stars host one or more massive companions with 1 {\textless}
m/MJ {\textless} 13 and 0 {\textless} a {\textless} 20 AU. These results are lower
than analyses of the planet occurrence rate around higher-mass stars. We
find the giant planet occurrence rate is described by a double power law
in stellar mass M and metallicity F ≡ [Fe/H] such that f(M,F) =
0.039{\textasciicircum}\{+0.056\}\_\{-0.028\} M{\textasciicircum}\{0.8{\textasciicircum}\{+1.1\}\_\{-0.9\}\} 10{\textasciicircum}\{(3.8 +/- 1.2)F\}. Our

	abstract = {We conducted a Doppler survey at Keck combined with NIRC2 K-band adaptive optics (AO) imaging to search for massive, long-period
companions to 123 known exoplanet systems with one or two planets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Our survey is sensitive to Jupiter-mass planets out to 20 au for a majority of stars in our sample, and we report the discovery of eight new long-period planets, in addition to 20 systems with statistically significant RV trends that indicate the presence of an outer companion beyond 5 au. We combine our RV observations with AO imaging to determine the range of allowed masses and orbital separations for these companions, and account for variations in our sensitivity to companions among stars in our sample. We estimate the total occurrence rate of companions in our sample to be 52 ± 5\% over the range 1-20 MJup and 5-20 au. Our data
also suggest a declining frequency for gas giant planets in these systems beyond 3-10 au, in contrast to earlier studies that found a rising frequency for giant planets in the range 0.01-3 au. This suggests either that the frequency of gas giant planets peaks between 3 and 10 au, or that outer companions in these systems have a different semi-major axis distribution than the overall population of gas giant planets. Our results also suggest that hot gas giants may be more likely to have an outer companion than cold gas giants. We find that planets with an outer companion have higher average eccentricities than their single counterparts, suggesting that dynamical interactions between planets may play an important role in these systems.},

We rule out instrumental issues, stellar activity, and the Applegate mechanism as possible causes. The light-time effect is also not favoured due to the non-detection of changes in the systemic velocity. Orbital decay and apsidal precession are plausible but unproven. WASP-4 b is only the third hot Jupiter known to show transit timing variations to high confidence. We discuss a variety of observations of this and other planetary systems that would be useful in improving our understanding of WASP-4 in particular and orbital decay in general.},

	abstract = {The transits of a distant star by a planet on a Keplerian orbit occur at time intervals exactly equal to the orbital period. If a second planet orbits the same star, the orbits are not Keplerian and the transits are no longer exactly periodic. We compute the magnitude of the variation in the timing of the transits, δt. We investigate analytically several limiting cases: (i) interior perturbing planets with much smaller periods; (ii) exterior perturbing planets on eccentric orbits with much larger periods; (iii) both planets on circular orbits with arbitrary period ratio but not in resonance; (iv) planets on initially circular orbits locked in resonance. Using subscripts `out' and `in' for the exterior and interior planets, μ for planet-to-star mass ratio and the standard notation for orbital elements, our findings in these cases are as follows. (i) Planet-planet perturbations are negligible. The main effect is the wobble of the star due to the inner planet, and therefore δt{\textasciitilde}μ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}in{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}in{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater})P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. (ii) The exterior planet changes the period of the interior planet by μ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}in{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}){\textless}SUP{\textgreater}3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}in{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. As the distance of the exterior planet changes due to its eccentricity, the inner planet's period changes. Deviations in its transit timing accumulate over the period of the outer planet, and therefore δt{\textasciitilde}μ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}e{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}in{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}){\textless}SUP{\textgreater}3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. (iii) Halfway between resonances the perturbations are small, of the order of μ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}a{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}in{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/(a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}in{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}-a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}){\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}in{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} for the inner planet (switch `out' and `in' for the outer planet). This increases as one gets closer to a resonance. (iv) This is perhaps the most interesting case because some systems are known to be in resonances and the perturbations are the largest. As long as the perturber is more massive than the transiting planet, the timing variations would be of the order of the period regardless of the perturber mass. For lighter perturbers, we show that the timing variations are smaller than the period by the perturber-to-transiting-planet mass ratio. An earth-mass planet in 2:1 resonance with a three-dimensional period transiting planet (e.g. HD 209458b) would cause timing variations of the order of 3 min, which would be accumulated over a year. This signal of a terrestrial planet is easily detectable with current ground-based measurements. For the case in which both planets are on eccentric orbits, we compute numerically the transit timing variations for several known multiplanet systems, assuming they are edge-on. Transit timing measurements may be used to constrain the masses, radii and orbital elements of planetary systems, and, when combined with radial velocity measurements, provide a new means of measuring the mass and radius of the host star.},

	abstract = {Transit timing variations (TTVs) of exoplanets are normally interpreted 
as the consequence of gravitational interaction with additional bodies
in the system. However, TTVs can also be caused by deformations of the
system transits by starspots, which might thus pose a serious
complication in their interpretation. We therefore simulate transit
light curves deformed by spot-crossing events for different properties
of the stellar surface and the planet, such as starspot position, limb
darkening, planetary period, and impact parameter. Mid-transit times
determined from these simulations can be significantly shifted with
respect to the input values; these shifts cannot be larger than 1\% of
the transit duration and depend very strongly on the longitudinal
position of the spot during the transit and the transit duration.
Consequently, TTVs with amplitudes larger than the above limit are very
unlikely to be caused by starspots. We also investigate whether TTVs
from sequences of consecutive transits with spot-crossing anomalies can
be misinterpreted as the result of an additional body in the system. We
use the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram to search for periods in
TTVs and conclude that low-amplitude TTVs with statistically significant
periods around active stars are the most problematic cases. In those
cases where the photometric precision is high enough to inspect the
transit shapes for deformations it should be possible to identify TTVs
caused by starspots; however, especially for cases with low
signal-to-noise in transit (TSNR ≲ 15) light curves it becomes
quite difficult to reliably decide whether these periods come from
starspots, physical companions in the system, or if they are random
noise artifacts.},

    MESA star's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends
    its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter.
    The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based
    Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS
    adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a numerical
    recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when
    many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the
    way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline
    mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M ⊙ stars through
    the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival
    on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular
    momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of
    rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We
    introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows
    the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This
    enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst,
    and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way

	abstract = {Transiting exoplanetary systems are surpassingly important among the planetary systems since they provide the widest spectrum of information for both the planet and the host star. If a transiting planet is on an eccentric orbit, the duration of transits T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}D{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is sensitive to the orientation of the orbital ellipse relative to the line of sight. The precession of the orbit results in a systematic variation in both the duration of individual transit events and the observed period between successive transits, P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}obs{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The periastron of the ellipse slowly precesses due to general relativity and possibly the presence of other planets in the system. This secular precession can be detected through the long-term change in P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}obs{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (transit timing variations, TTV) or in T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}D{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (transit duration variations, TDV). We estimate the corresponding precession measurement precision for repeated future observations of the known eccentric transiting exoplanetary systems (XO-3b, HD 147506b, GJ 436b and HD 17156b) using existing or planned space-borne instruments. The TDV measurement improves the precession detection sensitivity by orders of magnitude over the TTV measurement. We find that TDV measurements over a approximately 4yr period can typically detect the precession rate to a precision well exceeding the level predicted by general relativity.},

NGTS builds on the legacy of previous surveys, most notably WASP, and is designed to achieve higher photometric precision and hence find smaller planets than have previously been detected from the ground. It also operates in red light, maximizing sensitivity to late K and early M dwarf stars. The survey specifications call for photometric precision of 0.1 per cent in red light over an instantaneous field of view of 100 deg{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, enabling the detection of Neptune-sized exoplanets around Sun-like stars and super-Earths around M dwarfs. The survey is carried out with a purpose-built facility at Cerro Paranal, Chile, which is the premier site of the European Southern Observatory (ESO). An array of twelve 20 cm f/2.8 telescopes fitted with back-illuminated deep-depletion CCD cameras is used to survey fields intensively at intermediate Galactic latitudes. The instrument is also ideally suited to ground-based photometric follow-up of exoplanet candidates from space telescopes such as TESS, Gaia and PLATO. We present observations that combine precise autoguiding and the superb observing conditions at Paranal to provide routine photometric precision of 0.1 per cent in 1 h for stars with I-band magnitudes brighter than 13. We describe the instrument and data analysis methods as well as the status of the survey, which achieved first light in 2015 and began full-survey operations in 2016.

	abstract = {PLATO 2.0 has recently been selected for ESA's M3 launch opportunity (2022/24). Providing accurate key planet parameters (radius, mass, density and age) in statistical numbers, it addresses fundamental questions such as: How do planetary systems form and evolve? Are there other systems with planets like ours, including potentially habitable planets? The PLATO 2.0 instrument consists of 34 small aperture telescopes (32 with 25 s readout cadence and 2 with 2.5 s candence) providing a wide field-of-view (2232 deg {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) and a large photometric magnitude range (4-16 mag). It focusses on bright (4-11 mag) stars in wide fields to detect and characterize planets down to Earth-size by photometric transits, whose masses can then be determined by ground-based radial-velocity follow-up measurements. Asteroseismology will be performed for these bright stars to obtain highly accurate stellar parameters, including masses and ages. The combination of bright targets and asteroseismology results in high accuracy for the bulk planet parameters: 2 \%, 4-10 \% and 10 \% for planet radii, masses and ages, respectively. The planned baseline observing strategy includes two long pointings (2-3 years) to detect and bulk characterize planets reaching into the habitable zone (HZ) of solar-like stars and an additional step-and-stare phase to cover in total about 50 \% of the sky. PLATO 2.0 will observe up to 1,000,000 stars and detect and characterize hundreds of small planets, and thousands of planets in the Neptune to gas giant regime out to the HZ. It will therefore provide the first large-scale catalogue of bulk characterized planets with accurate radii, masses, mean densities and ages. This catalogue will include terrestrial planets at intermediate orbital distances, where surface temperatures are moderate. Coverage of this parameter range with statistical numbers of bulk characterized planets is unique to PLATO 2.0. The PLATO 2.0 catalogue allows us to e.g.: - complete our knowledge of planet diversity for low-mass objects, - correlate the planet mean density-orbital distance distribution with predictions from planet formation theories,- constrain the influence of planet migration and scattering on the architecture of multiple systems, and - specify how planet and system parameters change with host star characteristics, such as type, metallicity and age. The catalogue will allow us to study planets and planetary systems at different evolutionary phases. It will further provide a census for small, low-mass planets. This will serve to identify objects which retained their primordial hydrogen atmosphere and in general the typical characteristics of planets in such low-mass, low-density range. Planets detected by PLATO 2.0 will orbit bright stars and many of them will be targets for future atmosphere spectroscopy exploring their atmosphere. Furthermore, the mission has the potential to detect exomoons, planetary rings, binary and Trojan planets. The planetary science possible with PLATO 2.0 is complemented by its impact on stellar and galactic science via asteroseismology as well as light curves of all kinds of variable stars, together with observations of stellar clusters of different ages. This will allow us to improve stellar models and study stellar activity. A large number of well-known ages from red giant stars will probe the structure and evolution of our Galaxy. Asteroseismic ages of bright stars for different phases of stellar evolution allow calibrating stellar age-rotation relationships. Together with the results of ESA's Gaia mission, the results of PLATO 2.0 will provide a huge legacy to planetary, stellar and galactic science.},

Radial velocity observations quickly verified that the photometric signals were indeed produced by two transiting hot Jupiters. Our observations also show the presence of additional Doppler signals. In addition to short-period hot Jupiters, we find that the WASP-53 and WASP-81 systems also host brown dwarfs, on fairly eccentric orbits with semimajor axes of a few astronomical units. WASP-53c is over 16 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}sin I{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and WASP-81c is 57 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}sin I{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The presence of these tight, massive companions restricts theories of how the inner planets were assembled. We propose two alternative interpretations: the formation of the hot Jupiters within the snow line or the late dynamical arrival of the brown dwarfs after disc dispersal. We also attempted to measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for both hot Jupiters. In the case of WASP-81b, we fail to detect a signal. For WASP-53b, we find that the planet is aligned with respect to the stellar spin axis. In addition we explore the prospect of transit-timing variations, and of using Gaia's astrometry to measure the true masses of both brown dwarfs and also their relative inclination with respect to the inner transiting hot Jupiters.},

HATS-16 is slightly active and shows a periodic photometric modulation, implying a rotational period of 12 days, which is unexpectedly short given its isochronal age. This fast rotation might be the result of the tidal interaction between the star and its planet.

In this paper, we apply the method to two transiting hot Jupiter systems monitored with the Kepler spacecraft, Kepler-13A and HAT-P-7. For Kepler-13A, we find \{\{i\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}{\textbackslash}star {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}=81\{\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ +/- 5\{\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ and {\textbackslash}psi =60\{\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ +/- 2\{\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ adopting the spectroscopic constraint λ = 58.°6 ± 2.°0 by Johnson et al. In our solution, the discrepancy between the above λ and that previously reported by Barnes et al. is solved by fitting both of the parameters in the quadratic limb-darkening law. We also report the temporal variation in the orbital inclination of Kepler-13Ab, d{\textbar}cos {\textbackslash}\{\{i\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}orb{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}{\textbar}/dt=(-7.0+/- 0.4)× \{\{10\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}\} day\{\{s\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}\}, providing further evidence for the spin-orbit precession in this system. By fitting the precession model to the time series of \{\{i\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}orb{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}, λ, and \{\{i\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}{\textbackslash}star {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\} obtained with the gravity-darkened model, we constrain the stellar quadrupole moment \{\{J\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}=(6.1+/- 0.3)× \{\{10\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}\} for our new solution, which is several times smaller than \{\{J\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}=(1.66+/- 0.08)× \{\{10\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-4{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}\} obtained for the previous one. We show that the difference can be observable in the future evolution of λ, thus providing a possibility to test our solution with follow-up observations. The second target, HAT-P-7, is the first F-dwarf star analyzed with the gravity-darkening method. Our analysis points to a nearly pole-on configuration with {\textbackslash}psi =101\{\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ +/- 2\{\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ or 87\{\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ +/- 2\{\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ and the gravity-darkening exponent β consistent with 0.25. Such an observational constraint on β can be useful for testing the theory of gravity darkening.},

The plane of the planet's orbit is rapidly precessing, and its inclination only becomes sufficiently aligned with the primary star in the latter portion of the Kepler data. Thus three transits are present in the second half of the light curve, but none of the three conjunctions that occurred during the first half of the light curve produced observable transits. The precession period is ∼103 years, and during that cycle, transits are visible only ∼8.9\% of the time. This has the important implication that for every system like Kepler-453 that we detect, there are ∼11.5 circumbinary systems that exist but are not currently exhibiting transits. The planet's mass is too small to noticeably perturb the binary, and consequently its mass is not measurable with these data; however, our photodynamical model places a 1 σ upper limit of \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/26/apj517318ieqn3.gif] \$16{\textbackslash};M\_øplus \$ .

We analysed Kepler short cadence data up to Quarter 14, with a total time-span of 928 d, to reveal changes in transit duration, depth, asymmetry and identify the possible signals of stellar rotation and low-level activity. We investigated long-term variations of transit light curves testing for duration, peak depth and asymmetry. We also performed cluster analysis on Kepler quarters. We computed the autocorrelation function of the out-of-transit light variations. Transit duration, peak depth and asymmetry evolve slowly, due to the slowly drifting transit path through the stellar disc. The detected transit shapes will map the stellar surface on the time-scale of decades. We found a very significant clustering pattern with 3-orbit period. Its source is very probably the rotating stellar surface, in the 5:3 spin-orbit resonance reported in a previous study. The autocorrelation function of the out-of-transit light variations, filtered to 25.4 h and harmonics, shows slow variations and a peak around 300-360 d period, which could be related to the activity cycle of the host star.},

In this Letter, we analyse publicly available Kepler Q2-Q3 short-cadence observations, revealing a continuous light variation with a period of P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}rot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}= 25.43 ± 0.05 h and a half-amplitude of 21 ppm, which is linked to stellar rotation. This period is in exact 5:3 resonance with the orbit of KOI-13.01, which is the first detection of a spin-orbit resonance in a host of a substellar companion. The stellar rotation leads to stellar oblateness, which is expected to cause secular variations in the orbital elements.

The confidence of this trend is 3.85σ, and the two-sided false alarm probability is 0.012 per cent.

Assuming b≈ 0.25, KOI-13.01 may become a non-transiting object in 75-100 years.

	abstract = {PTFO 8-8695b represents the first transiting exoplanet candidate orbiting a pre-main-sequence star (van Eyken et al. 2012, ApJ, 755, 42). We find that the unusual lightcurve shapes of PTFO 8-8695 can be explained by transits of a planet across an oblate, gravity-darkened stellar disk. We develop a theoretical framework for understanding precession of a planetary orbit's ascending node for the case when the stellar rotational angular momentum and the planetary orbital angular momentum are comparable in magnitude. We then implement those ideas to simultaneously and self-consistently fit two separate lightcurves observed in 2009 December and 2010 December. Our two self-consistent fits yield M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 3.0 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 3.6 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} for assumed stellar masses of M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.34 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.44 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} respectively. The two fits have precession periods of 293 days and 581 days. These mass determinations (consistent with previous upper limits) along with the strength of the gravity-darkened precessing model together validate PTFO 8-8695b as just the second hot Jupiter known to orbit an M-dwarf. Our fits show a high degree of spin-orbit misalignment in the PTFO 8-8695 system: 69° ± 2° or 73.°1 ± 0.°5, in the two cases. The large misalignment is consistent with the hypothesis that planets become hot Jupiters with random orbital plane alignments early in a system's lifetime. We predict that as a result of the highly misaligned, precessing system, the transits should disappear for months at a time over the course of the system's precession period. The precessing, gravity-darkened model also predicts other observable effects: changing orbit inclination that could be detected by radial velocity observations, changing stellar inclination that would manifest as varying vsin i, changing projected spin-orbit alignment that could be seen by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, changing transit shapes over the course of the precession, and differing lightcurves as a function of wavelength. Our measured planet radii of 1.64 R {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and 1.68 R {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} in each case are consistent with a young, hydrogen-dominated planet that results from a "hot-start" formation mechanism.},

Moderate eccentricities are detected for the inner orbits as well (e=\{0.34\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.07{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.08{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for Kepler-448b and e=\{0.2\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.1{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for Kepler-693b). In the Kepler-693 system, a large mutual inclination between the inner and outer orbits (\{53\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-9{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+7{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textbackslash}deg or \{134\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+11{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textbackslash}deg ) is also revealed by the TDVs. This is likely to induce a secular oscillation in the eccentricity of the inner WJ that brings its periastron close enough to the host star for tidal star-planet interactions to be significant. In the Kepler-448 system, the mutual inclination is weakly constrained, and such an eccentricity oscillation is possible for a fraction of the solutions. Thus these WJs may be undergoing tidal migration to become hot Jupiters (HJs), although the migration via this process from beyond the snow line is disfavored by the close-in and massive nature of the companions. This may indicate that WJs can be formed in situ and could even evolve into HJs via high-eccentricity migration inside the snow line.},

The orbital plane of the EB is slightly inclined to the line of sight (i {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}EB{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 87.°33 ± 0.°06), while that of the planet is inclined by {\textasciitilde}2.°5 to the binary plane at the reference epoch. Orbital precession with a period of {\textasciitilde}11 yr causes the inclination of the latter to the sky plane to continuously change. As a result, the planet often fails to transit the primary star at inferior conjunction, causing stretches of hundreds of days with no transits (corresponding to multiple planetary orbital periods). We predict that the next transit will not occur until 2020. The orbital configuration of the system places the planet slightly closer to its host stars than the inner edge of the extended habitable zone. Additionally, the orbital configuration of the system is such that the CBP may experience Cassini State dynamics under the influence of the EB, in which the planet's obliquity precesses with a rate comparable to its orbital precession. Depending on the angular precession frequency of the CBP, it could potentially undergo obliquity fluctuations of dozens of degrees (and complex seasonal cycles) on precession timescales.},

We find that the mass loss rate drops by a factor of ≈1.5-2, while the angular momentum loss rate drops by a factor of ≈4 as the distance decreases past the Alfvén surface. This reduction in angular momentum loss is due to the interaction between the stellar and planetary Alfvén surfaces, which modifies the global structure of the stellar corona and stellar wind on the hemisphere facing the planet, as well as on the opposite hemisphere. The simulation also shows that the magnitude of change in angular momentum loss rate depends mostly on the strength of the planetary magnetic field and not on its polarity. The interaction, however, begins at greater separation if the overall field topology of the star and the planet are anti-aligned. Our results are consistent with evidence for excess angular momentum in stars harboring close-in giant planets and show that the reduction in wind-driven angular momentum loss can compete with, and perhaps dominate, spin-up due to tidal interaction.},

	abstract = {There is a unique solution of the planet and star parameters from a planet transit light curve with two or more transits if the planet has a circular orbit and the light curve is observed in a bandpass where limb darkening is negligible. The existence of this unique solution is very useful for current planet transit surveys for several reasons. First, there is an analytic solution that allows a quick parameter estimate, in particular of R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Second, the stellar density can be uniquely derived from the transit light curve alone. The stellar density can then be used to immediately rule out a giant star (and hence a much larger than planetary companion) and can also be used to put an upper limit on the stellar and planet radius even considering slightly evolved stars. Third, the presence of an additional fully blended star that contaminates an eclipsing system to mimic a planet transit can be largely ruled out from the transit light curve given a spectral type for the central star. Fourth, the period can be estimated from a single-transit light curve and a measured spectral type. All of these applications can be used to select the best planet transit candidates for mass determination by radial velocity follow-up. To use these applications in practice, the photometric precision and time sampling of the light curve must be high (better than 0.005 mag precision and 5 minute time sampling for a two-transit light curve).},

The offset does not appear to depend strongly on distance within this range, though there is marginal evidence that the offset increases (becomes slightly more negative) for distances ≳1 kpc, up to the 3 kpc distances probed by the test sample.

These radii are determined using only direct observables—the bolometric flux at Earth, the effective temperature, and the parallax provided by the Gaia first data release—and thus are virtually model independent, with extinction being the only free parameter. We also determine each star’s mass using our newly determined radius and the stellar density, a virtually model independent quantity itself from previously published transit analyses. These stellar radii and masses are in turn used to redetermine the transiting-planet radii and masses, again using only direct observables. The median uncertainties on the stellar radii and masses are 8\% and 30\%, respectively, and the resulting uncertainties on the planet radii and masses are 9\% and 22\%, respectively. These accuracies are generally larger than previously published model-dependent precisions of 5\% and 6\% on the planet radii and masses, respectively, but the newly determined values are purely empirical. We additionally report radii for 242 stars hosting radial-velocity (non-transiting) planets, with a median achieved accuracy of ≈2\%. Using our empirical stellar masses we verify that the majority of putative “retired A stars” in the sample are indeed more massive than ̃1.2 \{M\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉ {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Most importantly, the bolometric fluxes and angular radii reported here for a total of 498 planet host stars—with median accuracies of 1.7\% and 1.8\%, respectively—serve as a fundamental data set to permit the re-determination of transiting-planet radii and masses with the Gaia second data release to ≈3\% and ≈5\% accuracy, better than currently published precisions, and determined in an entirely empirical fashion.},

The low-obliquity (well-aligned) systems are those for which the expected tidal timescale is short, and likewise the high-obliquity (misaligned and retrograde) systems are those for which the expected timescale is long. At face value, this finding indicates that the origin of hot Jupiters involves dynamical interactions like planet-planet interactions or the Kozai effect that tilt their orbits rather than inspiraling due to interaction with a protoplanetary disk.

	abstract = {Recent analyses have revealed a mystery. The orbital period of the highly inflated hot Jupiter, WASP-12b, is decreasing rapidly. The rate of inspiral, however, is too fast to be explained by either eccentricity tides or equilibrium stellar tides. While dynamical stellar tides are possible, they require a subgiant structure for the star, whereas stellar models point toward a main sequence host. Here, we show that these hitherto irreconcilable observations might be explained by planetary obliquity tides if planet b's spin vector is trapped in a high-obliquity state maintained by a secular spin-orbit resonance with an unseen exterior perturbing planet. We derive constraints on the obliquity (\${\textbackslash}epsilon{\textbackslash}gtrsim50{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$), reduced tidal quality factor (\$Q{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime\}{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{7\}\$), and perturbing planet parameters (\$M\_\{2\}{\textbackslash}sim10-20M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$, \$a\_2{\textbackslash}lesssim0.04{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm AU\}\$) required to generate the observed orbital decay. Direct N-body simulations that include tidal and spin dynamics reinforce the plausibility of the scenario. Furthermore, we show that the resonance could have been captured when planet b's obliquity was small, making the proposed sequence of events easy to explain. The hypothetical perturbing planet is within the limits of current radial velocity constraints on the system yet is also detectable. If it exists, it could provide evidence in favor of the in situ formation hypothesis for hot Jupiters.},

	abstract = {This article presents and discusses a critical compilation of accurate, fundamental determinations of stellar masses and radii. We have
identified 95 detached binary systems containing 190 stars (94 eclipsing systems, and α Centauri) that satisfy our criterion that the mass and radius of both stars be known within errors of ±3\% accuracy
or better. All of them are non-interacting systems, and so the stars should have evolved as if they were single. This sample more than doubles that of the earlier similar review by Andersen (Astron Astrophys Rev 3:91-126, 1991), extends the mass range at both ends and, for the first time, includes an extragalactic binary. In every case, we have examined the original data and recomputed the stellar parameters with a consistent set of assumptions and physical constants. To these we add interstellar reddening, effective temperature, metal abundance,
rotational velocity and apsidal motion determinations when available, and we compute a number of other physical parameters, notably luminosity and distance. These accurate physical parameters reveal the effects of stellar evolution with unprecedented clarity, and we discuss the use of the data in observational tests of stellar evolution models in some detail. Earlier findings of significant structural differences between moderately fast-rotating, mildly active stars and single stars, ascribed to the presence of strong magnetic and spot activity, are confirmed beyond doubt. We also show how the best data can be used to test prescriptions for the subtle interplay between convection, diffusion, and other non-classical effects in stellar models. The amount and quality of the data also allow us to analyse the tidal evolution of the systems in considerable depth, testing prescriptions of rotational synchronisation and orbital circularisation in greater detail than possible before. We show that the formulae for pseudo-synchronisation of stars in eccentric orbits predict the observed rotations quite well, except for very young and/or widely separated stars. Deviations do occur, however, especially for stars with convective envelopes. The superior data set finally demonstrates that apsidal motion rates as predicted from General Relativity plus tidal theory are in good
agreement with the best observational data. No reliable binary data exist, which challenge General Relativity to any significant extent. The new data also enable us to derive empirical calibrations of M and R for single (post-) main-sequence stars above \{0.6 M\_\{odot\}\}. Simple, polynomial functions of T eff, log g and [Fe/H] yield M and R within errors of 6 and 3\%, respectively. Excellent agreement is found with independent determinations for host stars of transiting extrasolar planets, and good agreement with determinations of M and R from stellar models as constrained by trigonometric parallaxes and spectroscopic values of T eff and [Fe/H]. Finally, we list a set of 23 interferometric binaries with masses known to be better than 3\%, but without fundamental radius determinations (except α Aur). We
discuss the prospects for improving these and other stellar parameters in the near future.},

	abstract = {Transit and radial velocity observations indicate a dearth of 
sub-Jupiter-mass planets on short-period orbits, outlined roughly by two
oppositely sloped lines in the period-mass plane. We interpret
this feature in terms of high-eccentricity migration of planets that
arrive in the vicinity of the Roche limit, where their orbits are
tidally circularized, long after the dispersal of their natal disk. We
demonstrate that the two distinct segments of the boundary are a direct
consequence of the different slopes of the empirical mass-radius
relation for small and large planets, and show that this relation also
fixes the mass coordinate of the intersection point. The period
coordinate of this point, as well as the detailed shape of the lower
boundary, can be reproduced with a plausible choice of a key parameter
in the underlying migration model. The detailed shape of the upper
boundary, on the other hand, is determined by the post-circularization
tidal exchange of angular momentum with the star and can be reproduced
with a stellar tidal quality factor \{Q\}*{\textbackslash}prime

Building upon our previous work, we study the possibility that mass loss through Roche lobe overflow (RLO) may affect the evolution of these planets, and could possibly transform a hot Jupiter into a lower-mass planet (hot Neptune or super-Earth). We focus here on systems in which the mass loss occurs slowly (“stable mass transfer” in the language of binary
star evolution) and we compute their evolution in detail with the binary evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics. We include the effects of tides, RLO, irradiation, and photo-evaporation (PE) of the planet, as well as the stellar wind and magnetic braking. Our calculations all start with a hot Jupiter close to its Roche limit, in orbit around a Sun-like star. The initial orbital decay and onset of RLO are driven by tidal dissipation in the star. We confirm that such a system can indeed evolve to produce lower-mass planets in orbits of a few days. The RLO phase eventually ends and, depending on the details of the mass transfer and on the planetary core mass, the orbital period can remain around a few days for several Gyr. The remnant planets have rocky cores and some amount of envelope material, which is slowly removed via PE at a nearly constant orbital period; these have properties resembling many of the observed super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. For these remnant planets, we also predict an anti-correlation between mass and orbital period; very low-mass planets (Mpl ≲ 5
M⊕) in ultra-short periods (Porb {\textless} 1 day)
cannot be produced through this type of evolution.},

	abstract = {Many gaseous exoplanets in short-period orbits are on the verge or are in the process of Roche-lobe overflow (RLO). Moreover, orbital stability analysis shows tides can drive many hot Jupiters to spiral inevitably toward their host stars. Thus, the coupled processes of orbital evolution and RLO likely shape the observed distribution of close-in exoplanets and may even be responsible for producing some of the short-period rocky planets. However, the exact outcome for an overflowing planet depends on its internal response to mass loss, and the accompanying orbital evolution can act to enhance or inhibit RLO. In this study, we apply the fully-featured and robust Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics suite to model RLO of short-period gaseous planets. We show that, although the detailed evolution may depend on several properties of the planetary system, it is largely determined by the core mass of the overflowing gas giant. In particular, we find that the orbital expansion that accompanies RLO often stops and reverses at a specific maximum period that depends on the core mass. We suggest that RLO may often strand the remnant of a gas giant near this orbital period, which provides an observational prediction that can corroborate the hypothesis that short-period gas giants undergo RLO. We conduct a preliminary comparison of this prediction to the observed population of small, short-period planets and find some planets in orbits that may be consistent with this picture. To the extent that we can establish some short-period planets are indeed the remnants of gas giants, that population can elucidate the properties of gas giant cores, the properties of which remain largely unconstrained.},

consistently describe the distribution of extrasolar planetary systems in terms of period, eccentricity, and mass (with a lower limit of a Saturn mass) with this simple model. Our model is consistent with the survival of short-period exoplanet systems, but not with the
circularization period of equal mass stellar binaries, suggesting that the latter systems experience a higher level of dissipation than exoplanet host stars. Our model is also not consistent with the
explanation of inflated planetary radii as resulting from tidal
dissipation. The paucity of short-period planets around evolved A stars is explained as the result of enhanced tidal inspiral resulting from the increase in stellar radius with evolution.},

Tides raised on a planet's host star cause the planet's orbit to decay, even after the orbital eccentricity has dropped to zero. Comparison of the observed orbital distribution and predictions of tidal theory shows good qualitative agreement, suggesting tidal destruction of close-in exoplanets is common. The process can explain the observed cutoff in small semimajor axis values, the clustering of orbital periods near three days, and the relative youth of transiting planets. Contrary to previous considerations, a mechanism to stop the inward migration of close-in planets at their current orbits is not necessarily required. Planets nearing tidal destruction may be found with extremely small semimajor axes, possibly already stripped of any gaseous envelope. The recently discovered CoroT-7 b may be an example of such a planet and will probably be destroyed by tides within the next few Gyrs. Also, where one or more planets have already been accreted, a star may exhibit an unusual composition and/or spin rate.},

  abstract = {In order to explain the inflated radii of some transiting extrasolar giant planets, we investigate a tidal heating scenario for the inflated planets WASP-4b, WASP-6b, WASP-12b, WASP-15b, and TrES-4. To do so, we assume that they retain a nonzero eccentricity, possibly by dint of continuing interaction with a third body. We calculate the amount of extra heating in the envelope that is then required to fit the radius of each planet, and we explore how this additional power depends on the planetary atmospheric opacity and on the mass of a heavy-element central core. There is a degeneracy between the core mass M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}core{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and the heating {\textbackslash}dot\{E\}\_heating. Therefore, in the case of tidal heating, there is for each planet a range of \{M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}core{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, e {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}/Q'{\textless}SUB{\textgreater} p {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\} that can lead to the same radius, where Q'{\textless}SUB{\textgreater} p {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is the tidal dissipation factor and e is the eccentricity. With this in mind, we also investigate the case of the non-inflated planet HAT-P-12b, which can admit solutions combining a heavy-element core and tidal heating. A substantial improvement of the measured eccentricities of such planetary systems could simplify this degeneracy by linking the two unknown parameters \{M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}core{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, Q'{\textless}SUB{\textgreater} p {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}. Further independent constraints on either of these parameters would, through our calculations, constrain the other.},

The planet is only 1.5 times the separation from its host star at which it would be destroyed by Roche lobe overflow, and has a predicted remaining lifetime of just ̃40 Myr, assuming a tidal dissipation quality factor of Q\_\{*\vphantom{\{}\}{\textasciicircum}'\}=10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. Q\_\{*\vphantom{\{}\}{\textasciicircum}'\} is a key factor in determining how frictional processes within a host star affect the orbital evolution of its companion giant planets, but it is currently poorly constrained by observations. We calculate that the orbital decay of WTS-2 b would correspond to a shift in its transit arrival time of T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}shift{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ̃ 17 s after 15 yr assuming Q\_\{*\vphantom{\{}\}{\textasciicircum}'\}=10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}.

We attempted to constrain Q\_\{*\vphantom{\{}\}{\textasciicircum}'\} via a study of the entire population of known transiting hot Jupiters, but our results were inconclusive, requiring a more detailed treatment of transit survey sensitivities at long periods. We conclude that the most informative and straightforward constraints on Q\_\{*\vphantom{\{}\}{\textasciicircum}'\} will be obtained by direct observational measurements of the shift in transit arrival times in individual hot Jupiter systems. We show that this is achievable across the mass spectrum of exoplanet host stars within a decade, and will directly probe the effects of stellar interior structure on tidal dissipation.},

	abstract = {Tidal dissipation within a short-period transiting extrasolar planet perturbed by a companion object can drive orbital evolution of the system to a so-called tidal fixed point, in which the apses of the transiting planet and its perturber are aligned, and variations in orbital eccentricities vanish. Significant contribution to the apsidal precession rate is made by gravitational quadrupole fields, created by the transiting planets tidal and rotational distortions. The fixed-point orbital eccentricity of the inner planet is therefore a strong function of its interior structure. We illustrate these ideas in the specific context of the recently discovered HAT-P-13 exoplanetary system, and show that one can already glean important insights into the physical properties of the inner transiting planet. We present structural models of the planet, which indicate that its observed radius can be maintained for a one-parameter sequence of models that properly vary core mass and tidal energy dissipation in the interior. We use an octupole-order secular theory of the orbital dynamics to derive the dependence of the inner planet's eccentricity, e{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}b{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} , on its tidal Love number, k {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2b {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}.

If a transiting planet is on an eccentric orbit, the duration of transits T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}D{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is sensitive to the orientation of the orbital ellipse relative to the line of sight. The precession of the orbit results in a systematic variation in both the duration of individual transit events and the observed period between successive transits, P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}obs{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The periastron of the ellipse slowly precesses due to general relativity and possibly the presence of other planets in the system. This secular precession can be detected through the long-term change in P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}obs{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (transit timing variations, TTV) or in T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}D{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (transit duration variations, TDV). We estimate the corresponding precession measurement precision for repeated future observations of the known eccentric transiting exoplanetary systems (XO-3b, HD 147506b, GJ 436b and HD 17156b) using existing or planned space-borne instruments. The TDV measurement improves the precession detection sensitivity by orders of magnitude over the TTV measurement.

Given our best current understanding of tidal interactions, a planet of Jupiter's mass around a solar-like star could have dynamically survived in an orbit with a period as short as ̃10 hr. Since radial velocities increase with decreasing period, we would expect to find those planets close to the tidal limit first, and, unless this is a very unusual system, we would expect to find many more. We also consider the tidal stability of planets around more evolved stars, and we reexamine in particular the question of whether the Earth can dynamically survive the red giant phase in the evolution of the Sun.},

Depending on the ratio of the mean density of the planet ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} to that of the star ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, a planet-star merger results in three possible outcomes. If ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≳5, then the planet directly plunges below the stellar atmosphere before being disrupted by tidal forces. The dissipation of orbital energy creates a hot wake behind the planet, producing a extreme ultraviolet (EUV)/soft X-ray transient that increases in brightness and temperature as the planet sinks below the stellar surface. The peak luminosity L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}EUV/X{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≲ 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}36{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} is achieved weeks to months prior to merger, after which the stellar surface is enshrouded by an outflow driven by the merger. The final stages of the inspiral are accompanied by an optical transient powered by the recombination of hydrogen in the outflow, which peaks at a luminosity of ̃10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}37{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}-10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}38{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} on a time-scale ̃days. If the star is instead significantly denser (ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≲5), then the planet overflows its Roche lobe above the stellar surface. For ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≲1 mass transfer is stable, resulting in the planet being accreted on the relatively slow time-scale set by tidal dissipation. However, for an intermediate-density range 1≲ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≲5 mass transfer may instead be unstable, resulting in the dynamical disruption of the planet into an accretion disc around the star. Outflows from the super-Eddington accretion disc power an optical transient with a peak luminosity of ̃10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}37{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}-10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}38{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} and characteristic duration ̃week-months. Emission from the disc itself becomes visible once the accretion rate decreases below the Eddington rate, resulting in a bolometric brightening and shift of the spectral peak to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. Optical transients from both direct-impact merger and tidal-disruption events in some ways resemble classical novae, but can be distinguished by their higher ejecta mass and lower velocity around hundreds of km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, and by hard pre- and post-cursor emission, respectively. The most promising search strategy is with combined surveys of nearby massive galaxies (e.g. M31) at optical, UV and X-ray wavelengths with cadences from days to months.},

WASP-45b is a 1.03-MJup planet which passes in front of the
limb of its K2V host star every 3.13 days. Weak Ca II H\&K emission
seen in the spectra of WASP-45 suggests that the star is
chromospherically active. WASP-46b is a 2.10-MJup planet in a
1.43-day orbit around a G6V star. Rotational modulation of the light
curves of WASP-46 and weak Ca II H\&K emission in its spectra show
the star to be photospherically and chromospherically active.

We imposed circular orbits in our analyses as the radial-velocity data
are consistent with (near-)circular orbits, as could be expected from
both empirical and tidal-theory perspectives for such short-period,
˜Jupiter-mass planets. We discuss the impact of fitting for
eccentric orbits for such planets when not supported by the data. The
derived planetary and stellar radii depend on the fitted eccentricity
and these parameters inform intense theoretical efforts concerning tidal
circularization and heating, bulk planetary composition and the observed
systematic errors in planetary and stellar radii. As such, we recommend
exercising caution in fitting the orbits of short-period,
˜Jupiter-mass planets with an eccentric model when there is no
evidence of non-circularity.},

We present a study of the planetary systems WASP-45 and WASP-46, both
composed of a main-sequence star and a close-in hot Jupiter, based on 29
new high-quality light curves of transits events. In particular, one
transit of WASP-45 b and four of WASP-46 b were simultaneously observed
in four optical filters, while one transit of WASP-46 b was observed
with the NTT obtaining a precision of 0.30 mmag with a cadence of
roughly 3 min. We also obtained five new spectra of WASP-45 with the
FEROS spectrograph. We improved by a factor of 4 the measurement of the
radius of the planet WASP-45 b, and found that WASP-46 b is slightly
less massive and smaller than previously reported. Both planets now have
a more accurate measurement of the density (0.959 ± 0.077
ρJup instead of 0.64 ± 0.30 ρJup
for WASP-45 b, and 1.103 ± 0.052 ρJup instead of
0.94 ± 0.11 ρJup for WASP-46 b). We tentatively
detected radius variations with wavelength for both planets, in
particular in the case of WASP-45 b we found a slightly larger
absorption in the redder bands than in the bluer ones. No hints for the
presence of an additional planetary companion in the two systems were

We consider the 31 transits with uncertainties in their mid-transit times (e\_T0) {\textless} 1 min, to perform the first homogeneous study of TTVs for the system, finding a dispersion of σ = 1.66 min over a 6 yr baseline. Since no periodic variations are found, our interpretation for this relatively high value of σ is that the stellar activity could be affecting the measured mid-transit times. This value of dispersion allows us to rule out the presence of additional bodies with masses larger than 2.3, 4.6, 7 and 9.3 M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\} at the first-order mean-motion resonances 2:1, 3:2, 4:3 and 5:4 with the transiting planet, respectively.

The hot Jupiters closest to their parent stars, at orbital distances of only {\textasciitilde}0.02 astronomical units, have strong tidal interactions, and systems such as OGLE-TR-56 have been suggested as tests of tidal dissipation theory. Here we report the discovery of planet WASP-18b with an orbital period of 0.94days and a mass of ten Jupiter masses
(10MJup), resulting in a tidal interaction an order of magnitude stronger than that of planet OGLE-TR-56b. Under the assumption that the tidal-dissipation parameter Q of the host star is of the order of 106, as measured for Solar System bodies and binary stars and as often applied to extrasolar planets, WASP-18b will be spiralling inwards on a timescale less than a thousandth that of the lifetime of its host star. Therefore either WASP-18 is in a rare, exceptionally short-lived state, or the tidal dissipation in this system (and possibly other hot-Jupiter systems) must be much weaker than in the Solar System.},

These light curves are used to measure the amplitude, shape and phase of the thermal phase effect for WASP-18 b. We find that our results for the thermal phase effect are limited to an accuracy of about 0.01 per cent by systematic noise sources of unknown origin. At this level of accuracy we find that the thermal phase effect has a peak-to-peak amplitude approximately equal to the secondary eclipse depth, has a sinusoidal shape and that the maximum brightness occurs at the same phase as mid-occultation to within about 5 ° at 3.6 μm
and to within about 10 ° at 4.5 μm. The shape and amplitude of
the thermal phase curve imply very low levels of heat redistribution within the atmosphere of the planet. We also perform a separate analysis to determine the system geometry by fitting a light curve model to the data covering the occultation and the transit. The secondary eclipse depths we measure at 3.6 and 4.5 μm are in good agreement with
previous measurements and imply a very low albedo for WASP-18 b. The parameters of the system (masses, radii, etc.) derived from our analysis are also in good agreement with those from previous studies, but with improved precision. We use new high-resolution imaging and published limits on the rate of change of the mean radial velocity to check for the presence of any faint companion stars that may affect our results. We find that there is unlikely to be any significant contribution to the flux at Spitzer wavelengths from a stellar companion to WASP-18. We find that there is no evidence for variations in the times of eclipse from a linear ephemeris greater than about 100 s over 3 years.},

Previous analysis predicted a rapid orbital decay of the planet toward its host star that should be
measurable on the timescale of a few years, if the star is as
dissipative as is inferred from the circularization of close-in
solar-type binary stars. We have compiled published transit and
secondary eclipse timing (as observed by WASP, TRAPPIST, and Spitzer) with more recent unpublished light curves (as observed by TRAPPIST and Hubble Space Telescope) with coverage spanning nine years. We find no signature of a rapid decay. We conclude that the absence of rapid orbital decay most likely derives from Q‧ being larger than was
inferred from solar-type stars and find that Q‧ ≥ 1 ×
106, at 95\% confidence; this supports previous work
suggesting that F stars, with their convective cores and thin convective envelopes, are significantly less tidally dissipative than solar-type stars, with radiative cores and large convective envelopes.},

combined analysis of the WASP photometry, high-precision followup
transit photometry and radial velocities yield a planetary mass

0.870+0.025-0.036 R\_⊙. The non-zero orbital
eccentricity e = 0.054{\textasciicircum}+0.018-0.015 that we measure suggests
that the planet underwent a massive tidal heating 1 Gyr ago that could
have contributed to its inflated radius. High-precision radial
velocities obtained during a transit allow us to measure a sky-projected
angle between the stellar spin and orbital axis β =
11+14-18 deg. In addition to similar published
measurements, this result favors a dominant migration mechanism based on
tidal interactions with a protoplanetary disk.

ρJup. These values are consistent with those found in the literature. In the likely hypothesis that the two spot anomalies are caused by the same starspot or starspot complex, we measure the stars rotation period and velocity to be 23.80 ± 0.15 d and 1.78
± 0.20 km s-1, respectively, at a colatitude of
75.8°. We find that the sky-projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis is λ = 7.2° ±
3.7°, indicating axial alignment. Our results are consistent with and more precise than published spectroscopic measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. These results suggest that WASP-6 b formed at a much greater distance from its host star and suffered orbital decay through tidal interactions with the protoplanetary disc.},

The observations were carried out using multi-object differential spectrophotometry with the Inamori-Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph on the Baade Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We model systematic effects on the observed light curves using principal component analysis on the comparison stars and allow for the presence of short and long memory correlation structure in our Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis of the transit light curves for WASP-6. The measured transmission spectrum presents a general trend of decreasing apparent planetary size with wavelength and lacks evidence for broad spectral features of Na and K predicted by clear atmosphere models. The spectrum is consistent with that expected for scattering that is more efficient in the blue, as could be caused by hazes or condensates in the atmosphere of WASP-6b. WASP-6b therefore appears to be yet another massive exoplanet with evidence for a mostly featureless transmission spectrum, underscoring the importance that hazes and condensates can have in determining the transmission spectra of exoplanets.},

From the derived light curves we have extracted the midtransit times, transit depths and transit durations for these events. The precise midtransit times obtained help improve the orbital periods and also constrain transit-time variations of the systems. For most cases the published system parameters successfully accounted for our observed light curves, but in some instances we derive improved planetary radii and orbital periods. We complemented our 2.1 m infrared observations using CCD z‧-band and B-band photometry (plus two
Hα filter observations) obtained with the Kitt Peak Visitor Center Telescope, and with four H-band transits observed in 2007 October with the NSO’s 1.6 m McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope. The principal
highlights of our results are (1) Our ensemble of J-band planetary radii agree with optical radii, with the best-fit relation being
(Rp/R∗)J = 0.0017 +
0.979(Rp/R∗)vis. (2) We observe starspot crossings during the transit of WASP-11/HAT-P-10. (3) We detect starspot crossings by HAT-P-11b (Kepler-3b), thus confirming that the magnetic evolution of the stellar active regions can be monitored even after the Kepler mission has ended. (4) We confirm a grazing transit for HAT-P-27/WASP-40. In total, we present 57 individual transits of 32 known exoplanet systems.},

The resulting spectrum covers the range 0.29-4.5 μm. We find evidence for modest stellar activity of WASP-6 and take it into account in the transmission spectrum. The overall main characteristic of the spectrum is an increasing radius as a function of decreasing wavelength
corresponding to a change of Δ (Rp / R*) = 0.0071 from 0.33 to 4.5 μm. The spectrum suggests an effective
extinction cross-section with a power law of index consistent with Rayleigh scattering, with temperatures of 973 ± 144 K at the
planetary terminator. We compare the transmission spectrum with
hot-Jupiter atmospheric models including condensate-free and
aerosol-dominated models incorporating Mie theory. While none of the clear-atmosphere models is found to be in good agreement with the data, we find that the complete spectrum can be described by models that include significant opacity from aerosols including Fe-poor
Mg2SiO4, MgSiO3, KCl and
Na2S dust condensates. WASP-6b is the second planet after HD 189733b which has equilibrium temperatures near ˜1200 K and shows prominent atmospheric scattering in the optical.},

Combining them with other available photometric and radial velocity (RV) data, we find that its transit timings do not match a linear ephemeris; the best-fit χ2 value is 32.2 with 9 degrees of freedom, which corresponds to a confidence level of 99.982\% or 3.7σ. This result indicates that excess variations of transit timings have been observed, either due to unknown systematic effects, or possibly due to real TTVs. The TTV amplitude is as large as 50 s, and if this is real it cannot be explained by some effect other than an additional body, or bodies. From RV data, we put an upper limit on the RV amplitude caused by a possible secondary body (planet) as 21 m s-1, which corresponds to its mass of 22-70M⊕ over the orbital period ratio of the two planets from 0.2 to 5.0. From the TTV data, using numerical simulations, we narrowed the limits down to 2M⊕ near 1:2 and 2:1 mean-motion resonances (MMRs) with WASP-5b at the 3σ level, assuming that the two planets are
co-planer. We also put an upper limit of 43M⊕
(3σ) on excess of Trojan mass using both RV and photometric data. We also find that if the orbit of the possible secondary planet is a circle or an ellipse of small eccentricity, it would be likely an orbit near that of low-order MMRs.},

both random and flat-fielding errors, we defocused the telescope so its
point spread function approximated an annulus of diameter 40 pixel (16

photometry plus an algorithm for optimally combining the ensemble of
comparison stars. The resulting light curves have point-to-point
scatters of 0.50mmag for the first transit and 0.59mmag for the second.
We construct detailed signal-to-noise ratio calculations for defocused

curves with the JKTEBOP code and combine the results with tabulated
predictions from theoretical stellar evolutionary models to derive the
physical properties of the WASP-5 system. We find that the planet has a
mass of Mb = 1.637 +/- 0.075 +/- 0.033MJup, a
radius of Rb = 1.171 +/- 0.056 +/- 0.012R Jup, a

a density of ρb = 1.02 +/- 0.14 +/-

planet's high equilibrium temperature of Teq = 1732 +/- 80K

Our goal is to provide a helpful reference for the exoplanet-related aspects of any Extended Mission, while recognizing this will be only one part of a larger community discussion of the scientific goals. We use Monte Carlo simulations to try and anticipate the quantities and types of planets that would be detected in each of 6 plausible scenarios for a one-year Extended Mission following the two-year Primary Mission. We find that: (1) there is no sharp fall-off in the planet discovery rate in the third year; (2) the quantity of newly detected sub-Neptune radius planets does not depend strongly on the schedule of pointings; (3) an important function of an Extended Mission would be improving our ability to predict the times of future transits and occultations of TESS-detected planets.},

	abstract = {Late-type secondaries in Algol binaries are rapidly rotating convective stars and thus should be chromospherically active (CA). They are examined with respect to observational manifestations which characterize already known CA stars: Ca II H and K emission cores, photometric variability attributable to starspots, soft x-ray emission, non-thermal radio emission, ultraviolet and infrared excess, and alternating period changes. The conclusion is that they can be regarded as another class of CA stars. In most respects they are literally indistinguishable from other CA stars. Ca II H and K emission cores are observed in the lobe-filling component of six semi-detached binaries: U Cep, RT Lac, RV Lib, AR Mon, S Vel, HR 5110. Alternating period changes are shown to occur only in Algols containing a late-type (convective) star. It is proposed, therefore, that the Matese-Whitmire mechanism explains these changes. Specifically, the interval from one increase (or decrease) to the next can be equated with the star's magnetic cycle. Cycle lengths for 31 stars, derived in this way, range between 7 years and 109 years, with a median of 50 years.},

The main part of the work is a simultaneous analysis of 21 different photoelectric light-curves. The secondary component fills its Roche lobe, and its temperature is near 5000 K (plus or minus 500 K). The observations of circumstellar matter cannot be explained by a narrow ('particle dynamics') stream from Algol B to Algol A, and probably magnetic forces play a role. The period-changes indicate that mass and angular momentum are lost from the system, and again magnetic interactions could be involved. Speculatively, the 32(y) periodicity (which is not strict) is interpreted as some kind of magnetic cycle.},

	abstract = {Of the 14 transiting extrasolar planetary systems for which radii have been measured, at least three appear to be considerably larger than theoretical estimates suggest. It has been proposed by Bodenheimer, Lin \&amp; Mardling that undetected companions acting to excite the orbital eccentricity are responsible for these oversized planets, as they find new equilibrium radii in response to being tidally heated. In the case of HD 209458, this hypothesis has been rejected by some authors because there is no sign of such a companion at the 5 ms{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} level, and because it is difficult to say conclusively that the eccentricity is non-zero. Transit timing analysis as well as a direct transit search has further constrained the existence of very short period companions, especially in resonant orbits. Whether or not a companion is responsible for the large radius of HD 209458b, almost certainly some short-period systems have companions which force their eccentricities to non-zero values. This paper is dedicated to quantifying this effect. The eccentricity of a short-period planet will only be excited as long as its (non-resonant) companion's eccentricity is non-zero. Here, we show that the latter decays on a time-scale which depends on the structure of the interior planet, a time-scale which is often shorter than the lifetime of the system. This includes Earth-mass planets in the habitable zones of some stars. We determine which configurations are capable of sustaining significant eccentricity for at least the age of the system, and show that these include systems with companion masses as low as a fraction of an Earth mass. The orbital parameters of such companions are consistent with recent calculations which show that the migration process can induce the formation of low-mass planets external to the orbits of hot Jupiters. Systems with inflated planets are therefore good targets in the search for terrestrial planets.},

	abstract = {As clocks, pulsars rival the best atomic clocks on Earth. Though the rest-frame `tick' rate (period P) of any given pulsar is unknown, the rest-frame rates of change of the periods are known to be very small. Therefore when they are observed to be large, one is quite certain that the rate of changes must be due to changing Doppler shifts: dot\{P\} to acceleration, ddot\{P\} to jerk, and periodic shifts to orbiting companion stars or planets. The first two give otherwise unobtainable information on the density and masses of the stellar remnants in the cores of globular clusters. The orbits of binary pulsars provide a test of the theory of the evolution of red giant stars, and in globular clusters provide the first direct evidence for the three- and four-body encounters which are believed to determine the dynamical evolution of globular clusters. The orbits of binary pulsars in our own Galaxy also show evidence for the fluctuations which the fluctuation-dissipation theorem implies should occur during the dissipative tidal circularization of orbits. And newtonian dynamical effects may soon add irrefutable confirmation to recent observations suggesting that some pulsars are surrounded by planetary systems similar to our own. There may not be life on their planets, but pulsars certainly breathe new life into the study of newtonian dynamical systems.},

transiting extrasolar planets to probe the spatial variation of their
thermal emission. This technique permits an observer to resolve the
surface of the planet without the need to spatially isolate its light
from that of the central star. We evaluate the feasibility of this
technique for the HD 209458 system by simulating observations made with
the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). We consider two
representations of the planetary thermal emission: a simple model
parameterized by a sinusoidal dependence on longitude and latitude, and
the results of a three-dimensional dynamical simulation of the planetary
atmosphere previously published by Cooper \& Showman. We find that
observations of the secondary eclipse light curve are most sensitive to
a longitudinal asymmetry in the dayside planetary emission. To quantify
this signal, we define a new parameter, the ``uniform time offset,''
which measures the time lag between the observed secondary eclipse and
that predicted by a planet with spatially uniform emission. We compare
the predicted amplitude of this parameter for HD 20948 with the
precision with which it could be measured with IRAC. We find that IRAC
observations at 3.6μm of a single secondary eclipse should permit
sufficient precision to confirm or reject the Cooper \& Showman model
of the surface flux distribution for this planet. We quantify the
signal-to-noise ratio for this offset in the remaining IRAC bands and
find that a modest improvement in photometric precision should permit a
similarly robust detection.},

	abstract = {We observed two secondary eclipses of the exoplanet WASP-12b using the Infrared Array Camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The close proximity of WASP-12b to its G-type star results in extreme tidal forces capable of inducing apsidal precession with a period as short as a few decades. This precession would be measurable if the orbit had a significant eccentricity, leading to an estimate of the tidal Love number and an assessment of the degree of central concentration in the planetary interior. An initial ground-based secondary-eclipse phase reported by López-Morales et al. (0.510 ± 0.002) implied eccentricity at the 4.5σ level. The spectroscopic orbit of Hebb et al. has eccentricity 0.049 ± 0.015, a 3σ result, implying an eclipse phase of 0.509 ± 0.007. However, there is a well-documented tendency of spectroscopic data to overestimate small eccentricities. Our eclipse phases are 0.5010 ± 0.0006 (3.6 and 5.8 μm) and 0.5006 ± 0.0007 (4.5 and 8.0 μm). An unlikely orbital precession scenario invoking an alignment of the orbit during the Spitzer observations could have explained this apparent discrepancy, but the final eclipse phase of López-Morales et al. (0.510 ±{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.007{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.006{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) is consistent with a circular orbit at better than 2σ. An orbit fit to all the available transit, eclipse, and radial-velocity data indicates precession at \&lt;1σ a non-precessing solution fits better.

Our photometry brackets the secondary eclipse of WASP-12b in the Ks and H bands, and in J band starts in mid-eclipse and continues until well after the end of the eclipse. We detect its thermal emission in all three near-infrared bands. Our secondary eclipse depths are 0.309{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.013{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.012{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\% in Ks band (24σ), 0.176{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.016{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.021{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\% in H band (9σ), and 0.131{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.027{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.029{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\% in J band (4σ). All three secondary eclipses are best fit with a consistent phase, phi, that is compatible with a circular orbit: phi = 0.4998{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.0008{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.0007{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The limits on the eccentricity, e, and argument of periastron, ω, of this planet from our photometry alone are thus {\textbar}ecos ω{\textbar} \&lt; 0.0040. By combining our secondary eclipse times with others published in the literature, as well as the radial-velocity and transit-timing data for this system, we show that there is no evidence that WASP-12b is precessing at a detectable rate and that its orbital eccentricity is likely zero. Our thermal-emission measurements also allow us to constrain the characteristics of the planet's atmosphere; our Ks-band eclipse depth argues strongly in favor of inefficient day to nightside redistribution of heat and a low Bond albedo for this very highly irradiated hot Jupiter. The J- and H-band brightness temperatures are slightly cooler than the Ks-band brightness temperature, and thus hint at the possibility of a modest temperature inversion deep in the atmosphere of WASP-12b; the high-pressure, deep atmospheric layers probed by our J- and H-band observations are likely more homogenized than the higher altitude layer probed by our Ks-band observations. Lastly, our best-fit Ks-band eclipse has a marginally longer duration than would otherwise be expected; this may be tentative evidence for material being tidally stripped from the planet—as was predicted for this system by Li and collaborators, and for which observational confirmation was recently arguably provided by Fossati and collaborators.

The results of our analysis are: (1) a mean transit depth of 1.484\% ± 0.033\%, consistent with previous measurements and showing no evidence of variability in transit depth at the 3\% level. (2) A mean eclipse depth of 0.338\% ± 0.026\%, somewhat higher than that previously reported for this system; this new value brings observations into better agreement with models. From this eclipse depth we estimate an average dayside brightness temperature of 1320 ± 80 K; the dayside flux shows no evidence of variability at the 12\% level. (3) Eclipses in the system occur 32 ± 129 s earlier than would be expected from a circular orbit, which constrains the orbital quantity ecos ω to be 0.00004 ± 0.00033. This result is fully consistent with a circular orbit and sets an upper limit of 140 m s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} (3σ) on any eccentricity-induced velocity offset during transit. The phase curve observations (including one of the transits) exhibit an anomalous trend similar to the detector ramp seen in previous Spitzer/IRAC observations; by modeling this ramp we recover the system parameters for this transit. The long-duration photometry which follows the ramp and transit exhibits a gradual {\textasciitilde}0.2\% decrease in flux over {\textasciitilde}30 hr. This effect is similar to that seen in pre-launch calibration data taken with the 24 μm array and is better fit by an instrumental model than a model invoking planetary emission. The large uncertainties associated with this poorly understood, likely instrumental effect prevent us from usefully constraining the planet's thermal phase curve. Our observations highlight the need for a thorough understanding of detector-related instrumental effects on long timescales when making the high-precision mid-infrared measurements planned for future missions such as EChO, SPICA, and the James Webb Space Telescope.},

Of primary interest is the strong detection of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, the alteration of photospheric line profiles that occurs because the planet occults part of the rotating surface of the star. We develop a new technique for modeling this effect and use it to determine the inclination of the planetary orbit relative to the apparent stellar equator (λ=-4.4d+/-1.4d), and the line-of-sight rotation speed of the star (vsinI{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=4.70+/-0.16 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}). The uncertainty in these quantities has been reduced by an order of magnitude relative to the pioneering measurements by Queloz and collaborators. The small but nonzero misalignment is probably a relic of the planet formation epoch, because the expected timescale for tidal coplanarization is larger than the age of the star. Our determination of vsinI{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is a rare case in which rotational line broadening has been isolated from other broadening mechanisms.},

We use several novel techniques in our data analysis, the most important of which is a new correction for the detector "ramp" variation with a double-exponential function, which performs better and is a better physical model for this detector variation. Our main scientific findings are (1) an upper limit on the variability of the dayside planet flux of 2.7\% (68\% confidence); (2) the most precise set of transit times measured for a transiting planet, with an average accuracy of 3 s; (3) a lack of transit-timing variations, excluding the presence of second planets in this system above 20\% of the mass of Mars in low-order mean-motion resonance at 95\% confidence; (4) a confirmation of the planet's phase variation, finding the night side is 64\% as bright as the day side, as well as an upper limit on the nightside variability of 17\% (68\% confidence); (5) a better correction for stellar variability at 8 μm causing the phase function to peak 3.5 hr before secondary eclipse, confirming that the advection and radiation timescales are comparable at the 8 μm photosphere; (6) variation in the depth of transit, which possibly implies variations in the surface brightness of the portion of the star occulted by the planet, posing a fundamental limit on non-simultaneous multi-wavelength transit absorption measurements of planet atmospheres; (7) a measurement of the infrared limb darkening of the star, which is in good agreement with stellar atmosphere models; (8) an offset in the times of secondary eclipse of 69 s, which is mostly accounted for by a 31 s light-travel time delay and 33 s delay due to the shift of ingress and egress by the planet hot spot; this confirms that the phase variation is due to an offset hot spot on the planet; (9) a retraction of the claimed eccentricity of this system due to the offset of secondary eclipse, which is now just an upper limit; and (10) high-precision measurements of the parameters of this system. These results were enabled by the exquisite photometric precision of Spitzer IRAC; for repeat observations the scatter is less than 0.35 mmag over the 590 day timescale of our observations after decorrelating with detector parameters.},

	abstract = {`Hot Jupiter' extrasolar planets are expected to be tidally locked because they are close (\&lt;0.05 astronomical units, where 1AU is the average Sun-Earth distance) to their parent stars, resulting in permanent daysides and nightsides. By observing systems where the planet and star periodically eclipse each other, several groups have been able to estimate the temperatures of the daysides of these planets. A key question is whether the atmosphere is able to transport the energy incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which will determine the temperature at different points on the planet's surface. Here we report observations of HD 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetary systems, over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a `map' of the distribution of temperatures. We detected the increase in brightness as the dayside of the planet rotated into view. We estimate a minimum brightness temperature of 973+/-33K and a maximum brightness temperature of 1,212+/-11K at a wavelength of 8μm, indicating that energy from the irradiated dayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast to a recent claim for another hot Jupiter. Our data indicate that the peak hemisphere-integrated brightness occurs 16+/-6° before opposition, corresponding to a hotspot shifted east of the substellar point. The secondary eclipse (when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120+/-24s later than predicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit.},

	abstract = {We revisit the tidal stability of extrasolar systems harboring a transiting planet and demonstrate that, independently of any tidal model, none, but one (HAT-P-2b) of these planets has a tidal equilibrium state, which implies ultimately a collision of these objects with their host star. Consequently, conventional circularization and synchronization timescales cannot be defined because the corresponding states do not represent the endpoint of the tidal evolution. Using numerical simulations of the coupled tidal equations for the spin and orbital parameters of each transiting planetary system, we confirm these predictions and show that the orbital eccentricity and the stellar obliquity do not follow the usually assumed exponential relaxation but instead decrease significantly, eventually reaching a zero value only during the final runaway merging of the planet with the star. The only characteristic evolution timescale of all rotational and orbital parameters is the lifetime of the system, which crucially depends on the magnitude of tidal dissipation within the star. These results imply that the nearly circular orbits of transiting planets and the alignment between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbit are unlikely to be due to tidal dissipation. Other dissipative mechanisms, for instance interactions with the protoplanetary disk, must be invoked to explain these properties.},

	abstract = {Recent discoveries of several transiting planets with clearly non-zero eccentricities and some large obliquities started changing the simple picture of close-in planets having circular and well-aligned orbits. The two major scenarios that form such close-in planets are planet migration in a disk and planet-planet interactions combined with tidal dissipation. The former scenario can naturally produce a circular and low-obliquity orbit, while the latter implicitly assumes an initially highly eccentric and possibly high-obliquity orbit, which are then circularized and aligned via tidal dissipation. Most of these close-in planets experience orbital decay all the way to the Roche limit as previous studies showed. We investigate the tidal evolution of transiting planets on eccentric orbits, and find that there are two characteristic evolution paths for them, depending on the relative efficiency of tidal dissipation inside the star and the planet. Our study shows that each of these paths may correspond to migration and scattering scenarios. We further point out that the current observations may be consistent with the scattering scenario, where the circularization of an initially eccentric orbit occurs before the orbital decay primarily due to tidal dissipation in the planet, while the alignment of the stellar spin and orbit normal occurs on a similar timescale to the orbital decay largely due to dissipation in the star. We also find that even when the stellar spin-orbit misalignment is observed to be small at present, some systems could have had a highly misaligned orbit in the past, if their evolution is dominated by tidal dissipation in the star. Finally, we also re-examine the recent claim by Levrard et al. that all orbital and spin parameters, including eccentricity and stellar obliquity, evolve on a similar timescale to orbital decay. This counterintuitive result turns out to have been caused by a typo in their numerical code. Solving the correct set of tidal equations, we find that the eccentricity behaves as expected, with orbits usually circularizing rapidly compared to the orbital decay rate.},

Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets.

The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the
	scientific community focusses on data processing for which the
	international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and
	subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built
	spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page.

	abstract = {Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system. Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey.
	Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data
	products. Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the GBP (330-680 nm) and
	GRP (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

	abstract = {In anticipation of improved observational data for Jupiter’s gravitational field, from the Juno spacecraft, we predict the static tidal response for a variety of Jupiter interior models based on ab initio computer simulations of hydrogen-helium mixtures. We calculate hydrostatic-equilibrium gravity terms, using the non-perturbative concentric Maclaurin Spheroid method that eliminates lengthy expansions used in the theory of figures. Our method captures terms arising from the coupled tidal and rotational perturbations, which we find to be important for a rapidly rotating planet like Jupiter. Our predicted static tidal Love number, \{k\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=0.5900, is ̃10\% larger than previous estimates. The value is, as expected, highly correlated with the zonal harmonic coefficient J {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and is thus nearly constant when plausible changes are made to the interior structure while holding J {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} fixed at the observed value. We note that the predicted static k {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} might change, due to Jupiter’s dynamical response to the Galilean moons, and find reasons to argue that the change may be detectable—although we do not present here a theory of dynamical tides for highly oblate Jovian planets. An accurate model of Jupiter’s tidal response will be essential for interpreting Juno observations and identifying tidal signals from effects of other interior dynamics of Jupiter’s gravitational field.},

	abstract = {We present Spitzer Space Telescope infrared photometric time series of the transiting extrasolar planet system TrES-1. The data span a predicted time of secondary eclipse, corresponding to the passage of the planet behind the star. In both bands of our observations, we detect a flux decrement with a timing, amplitude, and duration as predicted by published parameters of the system. This signal represents the first direct detection of (i.e., the observation of photons emitted by) a planet orbiting another star. The observed eclipse depths (in units of relative flux) are 0.00066+/-0.00013 at 4.5 μm and 0.00225+/-0.00036 at 8.0 μm. These estimates provide the first observational constraints on models of the thermal emission of hot Jupiters. Assuming that the planet emits as a blackbody, we estimate an effective temperature of T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=1060+/-50 K. Under the additional assumptions that the planet is in thermal equilibrium with the radiation from the star and emits isotropically, we find a Bond albedo of A=0.31+/-0.14. This would imply that the planet absorbs the majority of stellar radiation incident upon it, a conclusion of significant impact to atmospheric models of these objects. We also compare our data to a previously published model of the planetary thermal emission, which predicts prominent spectral features in our observational bands due to water and carbon monoxide. This model adequately reproduces the observed planet-to-star flux ratio at 8.0 μm however, it significantly overpredicts the ratio at 4.5 μm. We also present an estimate of the timing of the secondary eclipse, which we use to place a strong constraint on the expression ecosω, where e is the orbital eccentricity and ω is the longitude of periastron. The resulting upper limit on e is sufficiently small that we conclude that tidal dissipation is unlikely to provide a significant source of energy interior to the planet.},

observe the target star and a comparison star simultaneously to produce
multiple light curves at varying wavelengths. The `white' light curve
and 15 `spectral' light curves are analysed to refine the system
parameters and produce a transmission spectrum from ˜515 to 720
nm. All light curves exhibit time-correlated noise, which we model using
a variety of techniques. These include a simple noise rescaling, a
Gaussian process model and a wavelet-based method. These methods all
produce consistent results, although with different uncertainties. The
precision of the transmission spectrum is improved by subtracting a
common signal from all the spectral light curves, reaching a typical
precision of ˜1 × 10-4 in transit depth. The
transmission spectrum is free of spectral features, and given the
non-detection of a pressure broadened Na feature, we can rule out the
presence of a Na-rich atmosphere free of clouds or hazes, although we
cannot rule out a narrow Na core. This indicates that Na is not present
in the atmosphere, and/or that clouds/hazes play a significant role in
the atmosphere and mask the broad wings of the Na feature, although the
former is a more likely explanation given WASP-29b's equilibrium
temperature of ˜970 K, at which Na can form various compounds. We
also briefly discuss the use of Gaussian process and wavelet methods to
account for time-correlated noise in transit light curves.},

	abstract = {Accurately understanding the interior structure of extra-solar planets is critical for inferring their formation and evolution. The internal density distribution of a planet has a direct effect on the star-planet orbit through the gravitational quadrupole field created by the rotational and tidal bulges. These quadrupoles induce apsidal precession that is proportional to the planetary Love number (\$k\_\{2p\}\$, twice the apsidal motion constant), a bulk physical characteristic of the planet that depends on the internal density distribution, including the presence or absence of a massive solid core. We find that the quadrupole of the planetary tidal bulge is the dominant source of apsidal precession for very hot Jupiters (\$a {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.025\$ AU), exceeding the effects of general relativity and the stellar quadrupole by more than an order of magnitude. For the shortest-period planets, the planetary interior induces precession of a few degrees per year. By investigating the full photometric signal of apsidal precession, we find that changes in transit shapes are much more important than transit timing variations. With its long baseline of ultra-precise photometry, the space-based {\textbackslash}emph\{Kepler\} mission can realistically detect apsidal precession with the accuracy necessary to infer the presence or absence of a massive core in very hot Jupiters with orbital eccentricities as low as \$e {\textbackslash}simeq 0.003\$. The signal due to \$k\_\{2p\}\$ creates unique transit light curve variations that are generally not degenerate with other parameters or phenomena. We discuss the plausibility of measuring \$k\_\{2p\}\$ in an effort to directly constrain the interior properties of extra-solar planets.},

Tidal interaction can modify the dynamics of the system through orbital alignment, circularization, synchronization and orbital decay by exchange of angular moment. Evidence for tidal circularization in close-in giant planet is well known. Here, we review the evidence for excess rotation of the parent stars due to the pull of tidal forces towards spin-orbit synchronization. We find suggestive empirical evidence for such a process in the present sample of transiting planetary systems. The corresponding angular momentum exchange would imply that some planets have spiralled towards their star by substantial amounts since the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc. We suggest that this could quantitatively account for the observed mass-period relation of close-in gas giants. We discuss how this scenario can be further tested and point out some consequences for theoretical studies of tidal interactions and for the detection and confirmation of transiting planets from radial velocity and photometric surveys.},

of the 4 Gyr-old open cluster M67 (=NGC 2682), obtained by analyzing
data from Campaign 5 of the K2 mission with the Kepler Space Telescope.
The rotation periods delineate a sequence in the color-period
diagram (CPD) of increasing period with redder color. This sequence
represents a cross-section at the cluster age of the surface P = P(t,
M), suggested in prior work to extend to at least solar age. The current
Sun is located marginally (approximately 1σ) above M67 in the CPD,
as its relative age leads us to expect, and lies on the P = P(t, M)
surface to within measurement precision. We therefore conclude that the
solar rotation rate is normal as compared with cluster stars, a fact
that strengthens the solar-stellar connection. The agreement
between the M67 rotation period measurements and prior predictions
further implies that rotation periods, especially when coupled with
appropriate supporting work such as spectroscopy, can provide reliable
ages via gyrochronology for other similar FGK dwarfs from the early main
sequence to solar age and likely until the main sequence turnoff. The
M67 rotators have a rotational age of 4.2 Gyr with a standard deviation
of 0.7 Gyr, implying that similar field stars can be age-dated to
precisions of ˜17\%. The rotational age of the M67 cluster as a
whole is therefore 4.2 Gyr, but with a lower (averaged) uncertainty of
0.2 Gyr.},

The distribution of orbital eccentricity versus orbital period (e-logP) displays a distinct transition from eccentric to circular orbits at an orbital period of {\textasciitilde}10 days. The transition is due to tidal circularization of the closest binaries. The population of binary orbits in M35 provide a significantly improved constraint on the rate of tidal circularization at an age of 150 Myr. We propose a new and more robust diagnostic of the degree of tidal circularization in a binary population based on a functional fit to the e-logP distribution. We call this new measure the ``tidal circularization period.'' The tidal circularization period of a binary population represents the orbital period at which a binary orbit with the most frequent initial orbital eccentricity circularizes (defined as e=0.01) at the age of the population. We determine the tidal circularization period for M35, as well as for seven additional binary populations spanning ages from the pre-main sequence ({\textasciitilde}3 Myr) to the late main sequence ({\textasciitilde}10 Gyr), and use Monte Carlo error analysis to determine the uncertainties on the derived circularization periods. We conclude that current theories of tidal circularization cannot account for the distribution of tidal circularization periods with population age. WIYN Open Cluster Study XXII.},

	abstract = {Following on from a recently completed radial-velocity survey of the old 
(7 Gyr) open cluster NGC 188 in which we studied in detail the
solar-type hard binaries and blue stragglers of the cluster, here we
investigate the dynamical evolution of NGC 188 through a sophisticated
N-body model. Importantly, we employ the observed binary properties of
the young (180 Myr) open cluster M35, where possible, to guide our
choices for parameters of the initial binary population. We apply
pre-main-sequence tidal circularization and a substantial increase to
the main-sequence tidal circularization rate, both of which are
necessary to match the observed tidal circularization periods in the
literature, including that of NGC 188. At 7 Gyr the main-sequence
solar-type hard-binary population in the model matches that of NGC 188
in both binary frequency and distributions of orbital parameters. This
agreement between the model and observations is in a large part due to
the similarities between the NGC 188 and M35 solar-type binaries.
Indeed, among the 7 Gyr main-sequence binaries in the model, only those
with P {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 1000 days begin to show potentially observable evidence for
modifications by dynamical encounters, even after 7 Gyr of evolution
within the star cluster. This emphasizes the importance of defining
accurate initial conditions for star cluster models, which we propose is
best accomplished through comparisons with observations of young open
clusters like M35. Furthermore, this finding suggests that observations
of the present-day binaries in even old open clusters can provide
valuable information on their primordial binary populations. However,
despite the model's success at matching the observed solar-type
main-sequence population, the model underproduces blue stragglers and
produces an overabundance of long-period circular
main-sequence-white-dwarf binaries as compared with the true cluster. We
explore several potential solutions to the paucity of blue stragglers
and conclude that the model dramatically underproduces blue stragglers
through mass-transfer processes. We suggest that common-envelope
evolution may have been incorrectly imposed on the progenitors of the
spurious long-period circular main-sequence-white-dwarf binaries, which
perhaps instead should have gone through stable mass transfer to create
blue stragglers, thereby bringing both the number and binary frequency
of the blue straggler population in the model into agreement with the
true blue stragglers in NGC 188. Thus, improvements in the physics of
mass transfer and common-envelope evolution employed in the model may in
fact solve both discrepancies with the observations. This project
highlights the unique accessibility of open clusters to both
comprehensive observational surveys and full-scale N-body simulations,
both of which have only recently matured sufficiently to enable such a
project, and underscores the importance of open clusters to the study of
star cluster dynamics.

In particular, two full eclipses of WASP-46b were observed, allowing us to demonstrate the repeatability of our observations via independent analyses on each eclipse. Significant numbers of eclipse depths for hot-Jupiters have now been measured in both Ks and the four Spitzer IRAC bandpasses. We discuss these measurements in the context of the broad-band colours and brightness temperatures of the hot-Jupiter atmosphere distribution. Specifically, we re-examine the proposed temperature dichotomy between the most irradiated, and mildly irradiated planets. We find no evidence for multiple clusters in the brightness temperature-equilibrium temperature distributions in any of these bandpasses, suggesting a continuous distribution of heat re-emission and circulation characteristics for these planets.},

The high-cadence ground-based technique is capable of detecting the faint signal of the secondary eclipse of extrasolar planets, which makes it a valuable complement to space-based mid-IR observations.

Additionally, the recent discovery of stellar binary companions 1” from WASP-12 has obfuscated interpretation of the observational data. Here we present new ground-based multi-object transmission-spectroscopy observations of WASP-12b that we acquired over two consecutive nights in the red optical with Gemini-N/GMOS. After correcting for the influence of WASP-12's stellar companions, we find that these data rule out a cloud-free H 2 atmosphere with no additional opacity sources. We detect features in the transmission spectrum that may be attributed to metal oxides (such as TiO and VO) for an O-rich atmosphere or to metal hydrides (such as TiH) for a C-rich atmosphere. We also reanalyzed NIR transit-spectroscopy observations of WASP-12b from HST /WFC3 and broadband transit photometry from Warm Spitzer . We attribute the broad spectral features in the WFC3 data to either H 2 O or CH 4 and HCN for an O-rich or C-rich atmosphere, respectively. The Spitzer data suggest shallower transit depths than the models predict at infrared wavelengths, albeit at low statistical significance. A multi-instrument, broad-wavelength analysis of WASP-12b suggests that the transmission spectrum is well approximated by a simple Rayleigh scattering model with a planet terminator temperature of 1870 ± 130 K. We conclude that additional high-precision data and isolated spectroscopic measurements of the companion stars are required to place definitive constraints on the composition of WASP-12b's atmosphere.},

and brown-dwarf systems from existing photometric observations and
measured spectroscopic parameters. The systems studied include 15
observed by the CoRoT satellite, 10 by Kepler and five by the Deep
Impact spacecraft. Inclusion of the objects studied in previous papers
leads to a sample of 58 transiting systems with homogeneously measured
properties. The Kepler data include observations from Quarter 2, and my
analyses of several of the systems are the first to be based on
short-cadence data from this satellite.

The light curves are modelled using the JKTEBOP code, with attention
paid to the treatment of limb darkening, contaminating light, orbital
eccentricity, correlated noise and numerical integration over long
exposure times. The physical properties are derived from the light-curve
parameters, spectroscopic characteristics of the host star and
constraints from five sets of theoretical stellar model predictions. An
alternative approach using a calibration from eclipsing binary star
systems is explored and found to give comparable results whilst imposing
a much smaller computational burden.

My results are in good agreement with published properties for most of
the transiting systems, but discrepancies are identified for CoRoT-5,
CoRoT-8, CoRoT-13, Kepler-5 and Kepler-7. Many of the error bars quoted
in the literature are underestimated. Refined orbital ephemerides are
given for CoRoT-8 and for the Kepler planets. Asteroseismic constraints
on the density of the host stars are in good agreement with the
photometric equivalents for HD 17156 and TrES-2, but not for HAT-P-7 and
HAT-P-11.

Complete error budgets are generated for each transiting system,
allowing identification of the observations best-suited to improve
measurements of their physical properties. Whilst most systems would
benefit from further photometry and spectroscopy, HD 17156, HD 80606,
HAT-P-7 and TrES-2 are now extremely well characterized. HAT-P-11 is an
exceptional candidate for studying starspots. The orbital ephemerides of
some transiting systems are becoming uncertain and they should be
re-observed in the near future.

The primary results from the current work and from previous papers in
the series have been placed in an online catalogue, from where they can
be obtained in a range of formats for reference and further study.

The geological activity is thought to be the result of tides raised by Jupiter, but it is not known whether the current tidal heat production is sufficiently high to generate the observed surface heat flow. Io's tidal heat comes from the orbital energy of the Io-Jupiter system (resulting in orbital acceleration), whereas dissipation of energy in Jupiter causes Io's orbital motion to decelerate. Here we report a determination of the tidal dissipation in Io and Jupiter through its effect on the orbital motions of the Galilean moons. Our results show that the rate of internal energy dissipation in Io (k2/Q = 0.015+/-0.003, where k2 is the Love number and Q is the quality factor) is in good agreement with the observed surface heat flow, and suggest that Io is close to thermal equilibrium. Dissipation in Jupiter (k2/Q =
(1.102+/-0.203)×10-5) is close to the upper bound of
its average value expected from the long-term evolution of the system, and dissipation in extrasolar planets may be higher than presently assumed.

	abstract = {Secular changes brought about by tidal friction in the solar system are reviewed. The presence or absence of specific changes is used to bound the values of Q (the specific dissipation function) appropriate for the planets and satellites. It is shown that the values of Q separate sharply into two groups. Values in the range from 10 to 500 are found for the terrestrial planets and satellites of the major planets. On the other hand, Q for the major planets is always larger than 6 × 10 4. Estimates of tidal dissipation in the atmospheres of the Jovian planets lead to values of Q which are consistent with those we have calculated on the basis of secular changes in the satellites' orbits. However, it is difficult to reconcile these large Q's with the much smaller values obtained in laboratory tests of solids. Lyttleton's hypothesis that Pluto is an escaped satellite of Neptune is critically examined. Using the Q's we obtain for the major planets and their satellites, we show that any eccentricity that Triton's orbit may have possessed after a near encounter with Pluto would have been subsequently damped, thus accounting for its present near-circular orbit.},

	abstract = {The negligible eccentricity of all extrasolar planets with periods less than 6 days can be accounted for by dissipation of tidal disturbances within their envelopes that are induced by their host stars. In the period range of 7-21 days, planets with circular orbits coexist with planets with eccentric orbits. These are referred to as the borderline planets. We propose that this discrepancy can be attributed to the variation in spin-down rates of young stars. In particular, prior to spin-down, dissipation of a planet's tidal disturbance within the envelope of a sufficiently rapidly spinning star can excite eccentricity growth and, for a more slowly spinning star, at least reduce the eccentricity-damping rate. In contrast, tidal dissipation within the envelope of a slowly spinning low-mass mature star can enhance the eccentricity-damping process. On the basis of these results, we suggest that short-period planets around relatively young stars may have a much larger dispersion in eccentricity than those around mature stars. We also suggest that because the rate of angular momentum loss from G and K dwarfs via stellar winds is much faster than the tidal transfer of angular momentum between themselves and their very short (3-4 days) period planets, they cannot establish a dynamical configuration in which the stellar and planetary spins are approximately parallel and synchronous with the orbital frequency. In principle, however, such configurations may be established for planets (around G and K dwarfs) with orbital periods of up to several weeks. In contrast to G and K dwarfs, the angular momentum loss due to stellar winds is much weaker in F dwarfs. It is therefore possible for synchronized short-period planets to exist around such stars. The planet around Tau Boo is one such example.},

	abstract = {In recent years it has been shown that the tidal coupling between extrasolar planets and their stars could be an important mechanism leading to orbital evolution. Both the tides the planet raises on the star and vice versa are important and dissipation efficiencies ranging over four orders of magnitude are being used. In addition, the discovery of extrasolar planets extremely close to their stars has made it clear that the estimates of the tidal quality factor, Q , of the stars based on Jupiter and its satellite system and on main-sequence binary star observations are too low, resulting in lifetimes for the closest planets orders of magnitude smaller than their age. We argue that those estimates of the tidal dissipation efficiency are not applicable for stars with spin periods much longer than the extrasolar planets' orbital period. We address the problem by applying our own values for the dissipation efficiency of tides, based on our numerical simulations of externally perturbed volumes of stellar-like convection. The range of dissipation we find for main-sequence stars corresponds to stellar Q * of 10 8 to 3 × 10 9 . The derived orbit lifetimes are comparable to or much longer than the ages of the observed extrasolar planetary systems. The predicted orbital decay transit timing variations due to the tidal coupling are below the rate of ms yr –1 for currently known systems, but within reach of an extended Kepler mission provided such objects are found in its field.},

	abstract = {WASP-12 is a hot Jupiter system with an orbital period of P = 1.1 days, making it one of the shortest-period giant planets known.

This has been interpreted as evidence of either orbital decay due to tidal dissipation or a long-term oscillation of the apparent period due to apsidal precession. Here, we consider the possibility that it is orbital decay. We show that the parameters of the host star are consistent with either a M * ≃ 1.3 M ⊙ main sequence star or a M * ≃ 1.2 M ⊙ subgiant.

	abstract = {As the quality and quantity of astrophysical data continue to improve, the precision with which certain astrophysical events can be timed becomes limited not by the data themselves, but by the manner, standard, and uniformity with which time itself is referenced. While some areas of astronomy (most notably pulsar studies) have required absolute time stamps with precisions of considerably better than 1 minute for many decades, recently new areas have crossed into this regime. In particular, in the exoplanet community, we have found that the (typically unspecified) time standards adopted by various groups can differ by as much as a minute. Left uncorrected, this ambiguity may be mistaken for transit timing variations and bias eccentricity measurements. We argue that, since the commonly-used Julian Date, as well as its heliocentric and barycentric counterparts, can be specified in several time standards, it is imperative that their time standards always be reported when accuracies of 1 minute are required. We summarize the rationale behind our recommendation to quote the site arrival time, in addition to using BJD\_TDB, the Barycentric Julian Date in the Barycentric Dynamical Time standard for any astrophysical event. The BJD\_TDB is the most practical absolute time stamp for extra-terrestrial phenomena, and is ultimately limited by the properties of the target system. We compile a general summary of factors that must be considered in order to achieve timing precisions ranging from 15 minutes to 1 microsecond. Finally, we provide software tools that, in principal, allow one to calculate BJD\_TDB to a precision of 1 microsecond for any target from anywhere on Earth or from any spacecraft.},

In some isolated systems this variation is at the measurable level (can be as high as 0.6 s yr –1 for GJ436) and may exceed all other transit-timing contributions (due to the general relativity, stellar quadrupole, etc.).

	abstract = {In this paper we search for distant massive companions to known transiting gas giant planets that may have influenced the dynamical evolution of these systems. We present new radial velocity observations for a sample of 51 planets obtained using the Keck HIRES instrument, and find statistically significant accelerations in fifteen systems. Six of these systems have no previously reported accelerations in the published literature: HAT-P-10, HAT-P-22, HAT-P-29, HAT-P-32, WASP-10, and XO-2. We combine our radial velocity fits with Keck NIRC2 adaptive optics (AO) imaging data to place constraints on the allowed masses and orbital periods of the companions responsible for the detected accelerations. The estimated masses of the companions range between 1-500 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, with orbital semi-major axes typically between 1-75 AU. A significant majority of the companions detected by our survey are constrained to have minimum masses comparable to or larger than those of the transiting planets in these systems, making them candidates for influencing the orbital evolution of the inner gas giant. We estimate a total occurrence rate of 51\% ± 10\% for companions with masses between 1-13 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and orbital semi-major axes between 1-20 AU in our sample. We find no statistically significant difference between the frequency of companions to transiting planets with misaligned or eccentric orbits and those with well-aligned, circular orbits. We combine our expanded sample of radial velocity measurements with constraints from transit and secondary eclipse observations to provide improved measurements of the physical and orbital characteristics of all of the planets included in our survey.},

The code is open source and has already been used in several published projects in the astrophysics literature. The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to ˜N2 for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our
	implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort. The code is available online at http://dan.iel.fm/emcee under the GNU General Public License v2.},

We apply these results to the HST observations of HD 209458, showing that the ratio of the planetary to stellar radii is 0.1207+-0.0003. These formulae give a fast and accurate means of computing lightcurves using limb-darkening coefficients from model atmospheres which should aid in the detection, simulation, and parameter fitting of planetary transits.},

These coefficients can be used in many different fields of stellar physics as synthetic light curves of eclipsing binaries and planetary transits, stellar diameters, line profiles in rotating stars, and others. The limb-darkening coefficients were computed specifically for the photometric system of the space mission TESS and were performed by adopting the least-square method. In addition, the linear and bi-parametric coefficients, by adopting the flux conservation method, are also available. On the other hand, to take into account the effects of tidal and rotational distortions, we computed the passband gravity-darkening coefficients \$y({\textbackslash}lambda)\$ using a general differential equation in which we consider the effects of convection and of the partial derivative \${\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}partial\{{\textbackslash}ln I({\textbackslash}lambda)\}/\{{\textbackslash}partial\{{\textbackslash}ln g\}\}{\textbackslash}right)\_\{T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\}\$. To generate the limb-darkening coefficients we adopt two stellar atmosphere models: ATLAS (plane-parallel) and PHOENIX (spherical, quasi-spherical, and \$r\$-method). The specific intensity distribution was fitted using five approaches: linear, quadratic, square root, logarithmic, and a more general one with four terms. These grids cover together 19 metallicities ranging from 10\${\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ up to 10\${\textasciicircum}\{+1\}\$ solar abundances, 0 \${\textbackslash}leq\$ log g \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 6.0 and 1500 K \${\textbackslash}leq\$ T\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 50000 K.

The algorithm searches for signals characterized by a periodic alternation between two discrete levels, with much less time spent at the lower level. We present numerical as well as analytical results to predict the possible detection significance at various signal parameters. It is shown that the crucial parameter is the effective signal-to-noise ratio - the expected depth of the transit divided by the standard deviation of the measured photometric average within the transit. When this parameter exceeds the value of 6 we can expect a significant detection of the transit. We show that the box-fitting algorithm performs better than other methods available in the astronomical literature, especially for low signal-to-noise ratios.},

We have used the data to refine the estimates of the system parameters and ephemerides. During two of the transits we observed a short-lived, low-amplitude anomaly that we interpret as the occultation of a starspot by the planet. We also found evidence for a pair of similar anomalies in previously published photometry. The recurrence of these anomalies suggests that the stellar rotation axis is nearly aligned with the orbital axis, or else the starspot would not have remained on the transit chord. By analyzing the timings of the anomalies we find the sky-projected stellar obliquity to be λ = -1{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+14{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}- 12{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} degrees. This result is consistent with (and more constraining than) a recent observation of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It suggests that the planet migration mechanism preserved the initially low obliquity, or else that tidal evolution has realigned the system. Future applications of this method using data from the CoRoT and Kepler missions will allow spin-orbit alignment to be probed for many other exoplanets.

We find secondary eclipse depths of 0.319\% ± 0.031\% and 0.343\% ± 0.027\% for the 3.6 and 4.5 μm bands, respectively, and show model emission spectra and pressure-temperature profiles for the planetary atmosphere. These eclipse depths are well fit by model emission spectra with water and other molecules in absorption, similar to those used for TrES-3 and HD 189733b. Depending on our choice of model, these results indicate that this planet has either a weak dayside temperature inversion or no inversion at all. The absence of a strong thermal inversion on this highly irradiated planet is contrary to the idea that highly irradiated planets are expected to have inversions, perhaps due the presence of an unknown absorber in the upper atmosphere. This result might be explained by the modestly enhanced activity level of WASP-4b's G7V host star, which could increase the amount of UV flux received by the planet, therefore reducing the abundance of the unknown stratospheric absorber in the planetary atmosphere as suggested in Knutson et al. We also find no evidence for an offset in the timing of the secondary eclipse and place a 2σ upper limit on {\textbar} e cos ω{\textbar} of 0.0024, which constrains the range of tidal heating models that could explain this planet's inflated radius.},

For WASP-4, the new estimates for the planet radius and mass from a combined analysis of our VLT data with previously published transit photometry and radial velocities are Rp =

0.85+0.11-0.07 M\_⊙. Our ground-based
photometry reaches 550 ppm at time sampling of {\textasciitilde}50 s. Nevertheless, we also report the presence of an instrumental effect on the VLT that degraded our photometry for the WASP-5 observations. This effect could be a major problem for similar programs.

photometric precision of 400-800 parts per million and a time sampling

Together with previously published times, the data are consistent with a
constant orbital period, giving no compelling evidence for period
variations that would be produced by a satellite or additional planets.
Analysis of the new photometry, in combination with stellar-evolutionary
modeling, gives a planetary mass and radius of 1.237 ± 0.064 M
Jup and 1.365 ± 0.021 R Jup, respectively.
The planet is 15\% larger than expected based on previously published
models of solar-composition giant planets. With data of the quality
presented here, the detection of transits of a "super-Earth" of radius
1.75 R ⊕ would have been possible.

We have used the data to refine the estimates of the system parameters and ephemerides. During two of the transits we observed a short-lived, low-amplitude anomaly that we interpret as the occultation of a starspot by the planet. We also found evidence for a pair of similar anomalies in previously published photometry. The recurrence of these anomalies suggests that the stellar rotation axis is nearly aligned with the orbital axis, or else the starspot would not have remained on the transit chord. By analyzing the timings of the anomalies we find the sky-projected stellar obliquity to be λ = -1{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+14{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}- 12{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} degrees. This result is consistent with (and more constraining than) a recent observation of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It suggests that the planet migration mechanism preserved the initially low obliquity, or else that tidal evolution has realigned the system. Future applications of this method using data from the CoRoT and Kepler missions will allow spin-orbit alignment to be probed for many other exoplanets.

Ground-based simultaneous multiband transit observations allow an accurate system parameter determination and may lead to the detection and characterization of additional bodies via the transit timing variations (TTVs) method. Aims: We aim to (i) characterize the heavily bloated WASP-4b hot Jupiter and its star by measuring system parameters and the dependence of the planetary radius as a function of four (Sloan g', r', i', z') wavelengths and (ii) search for TTVs. Methods: We recorded 987 images during three complete transits with the GROND instrument, mounted on the MPG/ESO-2.2 m telescope at La Silla Observatory. Assuming a quadratic law for the stellar limb-darkening, we derived the system parameters by simultaneous fitting a composite transit light curve over all bandpasses. To compute uncertainties of the fitted parameters, we employed the bootstrap Monte Carlo method. Results: The three central transit times are measured with precision down to 6 s. We find a planetary radius Rp = 1.413 ±
0.020 RJup, an orbital inclination i = 88.57 ° ±
0.45° and calculate a new ephemeris, a period P = 1.33823144

mid-times in combination with previous measurements shows no sign of a TTV signal greater than 20 s. We perform simplified numerical
simulations to place upper-mass limits of a hypothetical perturber in the WASP-4b system.

	abstract = {Context. Several competing scenarios for planetary-system formation and evolution seek to explain how hot Jupiters came to be so close to their parent stars. Most planetary parameters evolve with time, making it hard to distinguish between models. The obliquity of an orbit with respect to the stellar rotation axis is thought to be more stable than other parameters such as eccentricity. Most planets, to date, appear aligned with the stellar rotation axis; the few misaligned planets so far detected are massive (\&gt; 2 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Our goal is to measure the degree of alignment between planetary orbits and stellar spin axes, to search for potential correlations with eccentricity or other planetary parameters and to measure long term radial velocity variability indicating the presence of other bodies in the system. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: For transiting planets, the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect allows the measurement of the sky-projected angle β between the stellar rotation axis and a planet's orbital axis. Using the HARPS spectrograph, we observed the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for six transiting hot Jupiters found by the WASP consortium. We combine these with long term radial velocity measurements obtained with CORALIE. We used a combined analysis of photometry and radial velocities, fitting model parameters with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. After obtaining β we attempt to statistically determine the distribution of the real spin-orbit angle ψ. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We found that three of our targets have β above 90°: WASP-2b: β = 153°{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+11{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-15{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, WASP-15b: β = 139.6°{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+5.2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-4.3{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and WASP-17b: β = 148.5°{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+5.1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-4.2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}; the other three (WASP-4b, WASP-5b and WASP-18b) have angles compatible with 0°. We find no dependence between the misaligned angle and planet mass nor with any other planetary parameter. All six orbits are close to circular, with only one firm detection of eccentricity e = 0.00848{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.00085{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.00095{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} in WASP-18b. No long-term radial acceleration was detected for any of the targets. Combining all previous 20 measurements of β and our six and transforming them into a distribution of ψ we find that between about 45 and 85\% of hot Jupiters have ψ \&gt; 30°. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Most hot Jupiters are misaligned, with a large variety of spin-orbit angles. We find observations and predictions using the Kozai mechanism match well. If these observational facts are confirmed in the future, we may then conclude that most hot Jupiters are formed from a dynamical and tidal origin without the necessity to use type I or II migration. At present, standard disc migration cannot explain the observations without invoking at least another additional process. Using observations with the high resolution échelle spectrograph HARPS mounted on the ESO 3.6 m (under proposals 072.C-0488, 082.C-0040 \&amp; 283.C-5017), and with the high resolution échelle spectrograph CORALIE on the 1.2 m Euler Swiss Telescope, both installed at the ESO La Silla Observatory in Chile.RV data is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/524/A25"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/524/A25{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

TrES-2b, TrES-4b, and CoRoT-1b in transit; TrES-3b in secondary eclipse;
and WASP-4b in both. This wavelength region includes a predicted
absorption feature from water at 1.4 μm, which we expect to be
nondegenerate with the other molecules that are likely to be abundant
for hydrocarbon-poor (e.g., solar composition) hot Jupiter atmospheres.
We divide our wavelength regions into 10 bins. For each bin we produce a
spectrophotometric light curve spanning the time of transit or eclipse.
We correct these light curves for instrumental systematics without
reference to an instrument model. For our transmission spectra, our mean
1σ precision per bin corresponds to variations of 2.1, 2.8, and
3.0 atmospheric scale heights for TrES-2b, TrES-4b, and CoRoT-1b,
respectively. We find featureless spectra for these three planets. We
are unable to extract a robust transmission spectrum for WASP-4b. For
our dayside emission spectra, our mean 1σ precision per bin
corresponds to a planet-to-star flux ratio of 1.5 ×
10-4 and 2.1 × 10-4 for WASP-4b and TrES-3b,

measurements and conclude that for both planets isothermal atmospheres

a comparative exoplanetology survey program of close-in gas giants
conducted with GMOS. WASP-4b has an equilibrium temperature of 1700 K
and is favorable to study in transmission due to its large scale height
(370 km). We derive the transmission spectrum of WASP-4b using four
transits observed with the MOS technique. We demonstrate repeatable
results across multiple epochs with GMOS, and derive a combined
transmission spectrum at a precision about twice above photon noise,
which is roughly equal to one atmospheric scale height. The transmission
spectrum is well fitted with a uniform opacity as a function of
wavelength. The uniform opacity and absence of a Rayleigh slope from
molecular hydrogen suggest that the atmosphere is dominated by clouds
with condensate grain sizes of ˜1 μm. This result is consistent
with previous observations of hot Jupiters since clouds have been seen
in planets with similar equilibrium temperatures to WASP-4b. We describe
a custom pipeline that we have written to reduce GMOS time-series data
of exoplanet transits, and present a thorough analysis of the dominant
noise sources in GMOS, which primarily consist of wavelength- and
time-dependent displacements of the spectra on the detector, mainly due

	abstract = {The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ( TESS ) will be conducting a nearly all-sky photometric survey over two years, with a core mission goal to discover small transiting exoplanets orbiting nearby bright stars. It will obtain 30 minute cadence observations of all objects in the TESS fields of view, along with two-minute cadence observations of 200,000–400,000 selected stars. The choice of which stars to observe at the two-minute cadence is driven by the need to detect small transiting planets, which leads to the selection of primarily bright, cool dwarfs. We describe the catalogs assembled and the algorithms used to populate the TESS Input Catalog (TIC), including plans to update the TIC with the incorporation of the Gaia second data release in the near future. We also describe a ranking system for prioritizing stars according to the smallest transiting planet detectable, and assemble a Candidate Target List (CTL) using that ranking. We discuss additional factors that affect the ability to photometrically detect and dynamically confirm small planets, and we note additional stellar populations of interest that may be added to the final target list. The TIC is available on the STScI MAST server, and an enhanced CTL is available through the Filtergraph data visualization portal system at the URL http://filtergraph.com/tess\_ctl [http://filtergraph.com/tess\_ctl] .},

These modulations can be explained by the gravitational coupling of the orbit to variations in the shape of a magnetically active star in the system. The variable deformation of the active star is produced by variations in the distribution of angular momentum as the star goes through its activity cycle. The torque needed to redistribute the angular momentum can be exerted by a mean subsurface magnetic field of several kilogauss.},

	abstract = {Several authors have shown that precise measurements of transit time variations of exoplanets can be sensitive to other planetary bodies, such as exo-moons. In addition, the transit timing variations of the exoplanets closest to their host stars can provide tests of tidal dissipation theory. These studies, however, have not considered the effect of the host star. There is a large body of observational evidence that eclipse times of binary stars can vary dramatically due to variations in the quadrupole moment of the stars driven by stellar activity. In this paper, we investigate and estimate the likely impact such variations have on the transit times of exoplanets. We find in several cases that such variations should be detectable. In particular, the estimated period changes for WASP-18b are of the same order as those expected for tidal dissipation, even for relatively low values of the tidal dissipation parameter. The transit time variations caused by the Applegate mechanism are also of the correct magnitude and occur on time-scales such that they may be confused with variations caused by light-travel time effects due to the presence of a Jupiter-like second planet. Finally, we suggest that transiting exoplanet systems may provide a clean route (compared to binaries) to constraining the type of dynamo operating in the host star.},
